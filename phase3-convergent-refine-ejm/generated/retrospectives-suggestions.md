## Journey Step-Specific Questions

### Development Phase Questions (Steps 1-6)

**Onboarding (Step 1):**
- How long did it take you to make your first meaningful code contribution?
- What blocked you the most during your first week?
- Which tools or systems were hardest to set up?
- What information was missing from onboarding materials?

**Planning Work (Step 2):**
- How much time do you spend on planning vs. actual development?
- What tools do you wish you had for requirement gathering and estimation?
- Where do you lose time in the planning process?

**Architecture and Design (Step 3):**
- How do you currently document and share architectural decisions?
- What prevents you from reusing existing design patterns?
- Where do you need better tooling for design collaboration?

**QA Pre-Development (Step 4):**
- How early in the process do you involve QA?
- What testing infrastructure is missing or inadequate?
- Where do you spend the most time preparing for testing?

**Local Setup (Step 5):**
- How long does it take to set up a new project locally?
- What breaks most often in your local development environment?
- Which services are hardest to run locally?

**Local Development (Step 6):**
- What slows down your coding workflow the most?
- Where do you lose time debugging environment issues?
- What development tools would make you more productive?

### Testing Phase Questions (Steps 7-10)

**QA Isolated/Integrated/User Acceptance/Pre-Production (Steps 7-10):**
- How much time do you spend waiting for test environments?
- What testing tools or automation would save the most time?
- Where do tests fail due to environment differences rather than code issues?
- How often do you skip testing steps due to time pressure?
- What testing activities feel most manual and repetitive?

### Deployment Phase Questions (Steps 11-14)

**Prepare Change/Deploy Production/Release to Customers/QA Production (Steps 11-14):**
- How much manual effort is involved in your deployment process?
- Where do deployments fail most often?
- What deployment confidence do you have (scale 1-10)?
- How long does it take from code complete to customer availability?
- What deployment automation would provide the biggest value?

### Operations Phase Questions (Steps 15-17)

**Monitor/Observe and Support/Assess and Feedback (Steps 15-17):**
- How quickly do you know when something breaks in production?
- What monitoring or alerting gaps exist?
- How much time do you spend on production support vs. new development?
- What observability tools would help you troubleshoot faster?

### Improvement Phase Questions (Steps 18-20)

**Manage Tech Debt/Grow Capabilities/Continuous Improvement (Steps 18-20):**
- How do you currently prioritize tech debt vs. new features?
- What learning opportunities are you missing due to time constraints?
- Where do you see the biggest opportunities for process improvement?
- What would help you grow your skills more effectively?

## Facilitation Guidelines

### Pre-Retrospective Preparation

**For Facilitators:**
1. **Review the Journey Map:** Understand the 20 steps and current pain points documented
2. **Select Focus Areas:** Choose 4-6 journey steps most relevant to the team
3. **Prepare Materials:** Set up collaboration tools (Miro, Mural, or physical boards)
4. **Set Context:** Send agenda and journey map overview 24 hours in advance

**For Participants:**
1. **Review Your Experience:** Think about recent projects and where you experienced friction
2. **Bring Examples:** Prepare specific stories about delays, workarounds, or frustrations
3. **Consider Solutions:** Think about tools or processes that could help

### During the Retrospective

**Encouraging Participation:**
- Start with small groups (2-3 people) before sharing with larger group
- Use "I statements" to share personal experiences rather than generalizations
- Ask follow-up questions: "Can you give a specific example?" or "How did that impact your work?"
- Ensure quiet team members are heard by using written brainstorming first

**Capturing Insights Effectively:**
- Record pain points with specific examples and estimated time impact
- Document workarounds teams are already using (these often reveal improvement opportunities)
- Note frequency and severity of issues (daily annoyance vs. occasional blocker)
- Capture exact quotes that illustrate emotional impact ("I dread deployments")

**Managing Time and Focus:**
- Use timeboxing for each activity with visible timers
- Park off-topic issues in a "parking lot" for later discussion
- Redirect complaints toward constructive improvement suggestions
- Focus on issues the platform team can realistically address

### Post-Retrospective Actions

**Immediate (within 24 hours):**
- Send summary of captured feedback to all participants
- Share prioritized list with platform engineering team
- Schedule follow-up for sharing platform team responses

**Within 1 week:**
- Platform team reviews feedback and identifies quick wins
- Communicate back to engineering team about planned actions
- Update journey map with newly identified pain points

## Tips for Success

### Creating Psychological Safety
- Emphasize that feedback is about improving systems, not criticizing people
- Share examples of positive changes that resulted from previous feedback
- Acknowledge that some issues may be outside the platform team's control
- Focus on collective problem-solving rather than individual blame

### Getting Actionable Feedback
- Ask for specific examples rather than general complaints
- Probe for quantifiable impacts ("How much time does this cost you per week?")
- Encourage solution-oriented thinking ("What would ideal look like here?")
- Balance problem identification with opportunity recognition

### Following Through
- Communicate platform team responses to all feedback within one week
- Provide regular updates on improvement initiatives
- Celebrate wins and improvements, no matter how small
- Schedule regular follow-up retrospectives to track progress

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Information Overload:** Don't try to cover all 20 journey steps in one session
- **Blame Culture:** Focus on system improvements, not individual performance
- **Analysis Paralysis:** Balance thorough discussion with time for action planning
- **Platform Team Defensiveness:** Encourage platform team to listen first, defend later
- **Lack of Follow-through:** Always close the loop with engineering teams on their feedback

## Adapting for Remote Teams

### Virtual Retrospective Tools
- **Miro/Mural:** For visual collaboration and sticky note exercises
- **Retrium:** Specialized retrospective facilitation platform
- **Google Jamboard:** Simple, accessible option for basic retrospectives

### Remote Facilitation Tips
- Use breakout rooms for small group discussions
- Allow extra time for technical setup and transitions
- Encourage cameras on for better engagement
- Use collaborative polling for prioritization exercises
- Record key decisions and share notes immediately after the session
