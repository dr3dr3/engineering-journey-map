# 02. Planning Work

**Objective:** Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints  
**Duration:** 1-2 days per sprint cycle (Target: down from current 2-3 days)  
**Frequency:** Every 1-2 weeks per sprint planning cycle

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Break down features and requirements into clear, actionable development tasks following INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable)
- Provide accurate effort estimates based on historical data and team velocity patterns
- Understand business context and acceptance criteria for all assigned work through structured requirements
- Align with team on priorities, dependencies, and delivery timelines using data-driven planning tools

### Actions
1. Access unified planning dashboard with integrated requirements, dependencies, and estimation tools
2. Participate in structured backlog grooming with clear "definition of ready" criteria and quality checklists
3. Use AI-assisted story decomposition tools to break down large features into deliverable increments
4. Estimate effort using historical data patterns and team velocity metrics with calibration feedback
5. Leverage automated dependency detection and cross-team coordination tools
6. Commit to sprint goals with confidence using risk-based capacity planning
7. Track progress through integrated project management with real-time collaboration
8. Participate in automated cross-team coordination with clear visibility into integration points

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Unified planning dashboard, AI-powered estimation tools, automated dependency tracking, integrated collaboration platform
- **Tools & Systems:** Jira integration with enhanced workflows, Confluence for structured documentation, real-time collaboration tools, sprint analytics dashboard
- **People & Teams:** Product managers with structured requirements, scrum masters with data-driven facilitation, fellow engineers with shared context, QA teams with integrated planning

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Clear, testable requirements with AI assistance, confident estimation using historical data, realistic sprint commitments with risk visibility
- **Minimized Frustrations:** Reduced requirement ambiguity through structured templates, eliminated pressure through data-driven estimation, prevented scope creep through change control
- **Confidence Factors:** Well-defined acceptance criteria with automation, team alignment through shared dashboards, manageable scope based on capacity planning

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points (Based on Current State Documentation)
- **Large Story Problem:** Teams report stories are "too large to complete in a sprint" and struggle with "how to slice stories into smaller ones," leading to unpredictable sprint commitments
- **Requirement Ambiguity:** 30-40% of planning time spent clarifying vague requirements and missing acceptance criteria, creating significant waste
- **Estimation Pressure:** Engineers feel pressured to provide optimistic estimates without sufficient time for technical analysis or consideration of dependencies
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Need to switch between 4-5 different tools (Jira, Aha, Confluence, communication tools) to gather requirements and track progress
- **Scope Creep Impact:** Mid-sprint requirement changes invalidate original estimates and planning decisions, disrupting team flow
- **Cross-Team Coordination Complexity:** Difficulty tracking and coordinating dependencies across multiple teams and services without proper visibility

### Current Workarounds (Validated by Team Feedback)
- **Hidden Buffer Estimation:** Teams add "hidden buffers" to estimates to account for requirement clarification and scope changes
- **Informal Coordination Channels:** Use of private Slack channels and hallway conversations for coordination instead of formal processes
- **Personal Planning Tools:** Engineers maintain individual spreadsheets or notes to track actual progress versus official project management tools
- **Over-Communication:** Excessive meetings and check-ins to maintain alignment due to poor visibility tools

### Effort & Complexity (Current Reality)
- **Time Investment:** 4-8 hours per sprint for planning activities (15-20% of sprint capacity), plus ongoing coordination overhead
- **Skill Requirements:** Business analysis skills, estimation techniques, and understanding of technical architecture spread across team members
- **Cognitive Load:** High mental switching between business requirements, technical constraints, team coordination, and tool management

## Platform Engineering Opportunities
