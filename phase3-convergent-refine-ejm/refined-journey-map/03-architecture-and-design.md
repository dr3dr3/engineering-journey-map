# 03. Architecture and Design

**Objective:** Creating solution architectures, technical specifications, and design patterns before development begins  
**Duration:** 2-3 days per feature (Target: down from current 2-5 days)  
**Frequency:** Once per significant feature or system component

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Design scalable and maintainable technical solutions that meet functional and non-functional requirements using standardized patterns and templates
- Create clear technical specifications that guide development and enable efficient code reviews through unified design tools
- Identify and mitigate technical risks before development investment begins using automated validation and best practices
- Establish patterns and standards that can be reused across similar features and components through centralized pattern libraries
- Ensure alignment with existing system architecture and technology stack decisions through Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### Actions
1. Access centralized architecture workbench through unified developer portal (Atlassian Compass) for integrated design workflow
2. Leverage automated pattern detection and reusable design templates from organizational pattern library
3. Create technical specifications using standardized tools integrated with automated validation for organizational standards
4. Participate in asynchronous design reviews with structured feedback processes and clear approval criteria
5. Document design decisions in ADRs with searchable context and rationale for future reference
6. Validate design against security requirements and architectural principles through automated compliance checking
7. Generate API specifications and interface contracts using automated tools integrated with the design process
8. Share design knowledge through structured mentorship and cross-team collaboration platforms

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Unified developer portal, architecture workbench, automated pattern library, ADR repository, compliance validation tools
- **Tools & Systems:** Integrated design tools, Terraform for infrastructure patterns, automated API specification generation, security scanning integration
- **People & Teams:** Asynchronous design review processes, architecture mentorship programs, cross-functional design collaboration

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Pattern library accelerating design, automated validation providing immediate feedback, integrated tools reducing context switching
- **Minimized Frustrations:** Eliminated documentation hunting through centralized access, streamlined review processes, reduced architecture bottlenecks
- **Confidence Factors:** Automated compliance validation, reusable proven patterns, clear design guidelines, fast feedback cycles

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points (Based on Current State and Survey Feedback)
- **Documentation Fragmentation:** Architecture information scattered across multiple Confluence spaces making it "difficult to find what I need" and understand current system state
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Multiple disparate tools requiring context switching between diagramming, specification writing, and review systems affecting productivity
- **Review Bottlenecks:** Senior architect availability limiting design review capacity, with survey feedback indicating "waiting for approvals" causes significant delays
- **Pattern Inconsistency:** Lack of established design patterns leading to custom solutions for common problems and accumulating technical debt
- **Architectural Context Gaps:** Engineers report lacking understanding of system architecture and dependencies, making design decisions difficult
- **Requirements Translation Complexity:** Difficulty bridging gap between business requirements and technical implementation without domain expertise

### Current Workarounds
- **Informal Design Sessions:** Whiteboard sessions and hallway conversations replacing formal design review processes
- **Copy-Paste Architecture:** Duplicating existing component designs without proper abstraction or pattern recognition
- **Documentation Shortcuts:** Creating minimal design documentation to meet process requirements without comprehensive analysis
- **Tool Juggling:** Using multiple general-purpose tools that don't integrate, requiring manual effort for diagram maintenance

### Effort & Complexity (Current State)
- **Time Investment:** 16-40 hours per significant feature, with high variability based on complexity and review cycles
- **Skill Requirements:** System design expertise, understanding of scattered architectural patterns, knowledge of multiple tool ecosystems
- **Cognitive Load:** High complexity analyzing requirements, constraints, and trade-offs while navigating fragmented documentation and tools

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Design Pattern Detection:** Automated analysis of existing codebases using SonarQube and custom tools to identify and catalog reusable architectural patterns
- **Specification Generation:** Auto-generation of API specifications and interface contracts from design documents integrated with Swagger documentation
- **Compliance Validation:** Automated checking of designs against organizational architectural principles and security requirements using Infrastructure as Code validation
- **Architecture Visualization:** Automated generation of up-to-date system diagrams from actual infrastructure using Terraform state and service discovery

### Tooling Improvements (Aligned with IDP Initiative)
- **Architecture Workbench:** Integrated environment within Atlassian Compass combining diagramming, specification writing, and pattern library access
- **Live Documentation:** Documentation that stays synchronized with actual system implementation through automated code analysis and Terraform state
- **Design Template Library:** Pre-built templates for common architectural patterns with customization guidance and compliance validation
- **Unified Review Platform:** Streamlined design review workflows with automated notifications and approval tracking

### Process Optimization (Supporting Agile Practices)
- **Asynchronous Design Reviews:** Structured review processes that don't require real-time architect availability, supporting story slicing initiatives
- **Incremental Design Approval:** Breaking large designs into smaller reviewable components for faster feedback cycles, aligning with smaller work items goals
- **Pattern-Based Design:** Streamlined approval for designs that follow established organizational patterns, reducing review overhead
- **Risk-Based Review:** Automated risk assessment determining appropriate level of architectural review required

### Knowledge & Support
- **Architecture Decision Records:** Centralized repository in Confluence of past design decisions with searchable context and rationale
- **Interactive Design Guidelines:** Guided workflows that help engineers make architecture decisions aligned with organizational standards
- **Design Mentorship Programs:** Structured programs pairing junior engineers with architecture experts for design guidance, addressing junior developer needs
- **Cross-Team Pattern Sharing:** Regular architecture knowledge sharing sessions and pattern documentation updates
