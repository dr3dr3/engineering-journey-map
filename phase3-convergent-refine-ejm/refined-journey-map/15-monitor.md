## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Monitoring Tool Fragmentation:** Current Datadog implementation lacks unified visibility across web applications, mobile apps, data pipelines, and microservices, requiring manual correlation between different monitoring systems and custom dashboard creation for comprehensive system visibility
- **Alert Fatigue and Poor Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Excessive false positive alerts from poorly tuned monitoring thresholds, particularly for data pipeline monitoring, microservices health checks, and environment-specific configurations, reducing team responsiveness and effectiveness
- **Limited Domain-Specific Monitoring:** Insufficient observability for specialized requirements including data quality monitoring, mobile application crash analytics, customer-specific configuration tracking, and business intelligence correlation with technical metrics
- **Reactive Monitoring Approach:** Current monitoring discovers issues after customer impact rather than proactive identification through predictive analytics, trend analysis, and intelligent correlation of performance indicators with business operations
- **Complex Cross-Service Debugging:** Difficulty correlating issues across microservices architecture, data pipelines, mobile applications, and web services when monitoring systems provide fragmented visibility and require manual investigation procedures

### Workarounds
- **Manual Monitoring Correlation:** Engineering teams manually correlate metrics across Datadog, custom data pipeline monitoring, mobile crash reporting, and business intelligence tools when automated correlation capabilities are insufficient for comprehensive system analysis
- **Custom Monitoring Scripts and Dashboards:** Development of team-specific monitoring solutions including custom Slack alerts, manual log analysis procedures, and specialized data pipeline health checks when platform monitoring doesn't provide necessary domain visibility
- **Extended Manual Investigation:** Time-intensive manual troubleshooting procedures when monitoring systems don't provide sufficient context, automated investigation capabilities, or intelligent correlation for rapid issue diagnosis and resolution

### Effort & Complexity
