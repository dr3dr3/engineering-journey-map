# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary - Cloud Engineering & Infrastructure Team

**Team:** Cloud Engineering & Infrastructure Team  
**Date:** September 29, 2025  
**Participants:** 6 engineers (1 Principal, 2 Senior, 2 Mid-level, 1 Junior) + 1 Infrastructure Manager  
**Facilitator:** David Kumar (Principal Cloud Engineer)  

## Top Pain Points Identified (From Infrastructure Team Perspective)

### 1. **Infrastructure Request Management and Self-Service** - Journey Steps 2-3: High Impact
- **Frequency:** 15-20 infrastructure requests per week from engineering teams  
- **Time Lost:** 40-50% of team time on reactive support vs. strategic infrastructure work  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Engineering teams frequently need infrastructure resources (databases, queues, storage, compute) but lack self-service capabilities. This creates a bottleneck where infrastructure engineers spend most of their time on ticket-driven work rather than strategic improvements.

**Current Challenges:**
- Manual provisioning processes that take 2-3 days for simple requests
- No standardized infrastructure templates or guardrails
- Teams requesting infrastructure without understanding cost or operational implications
- Inconsistent security and compliance across manually provisioned resources

**Team Quotes:**
> "I became an infrastructure engineer to design scalable systems, not to be a human ticket router for database provisioning requests." - Alex (Senior Cloud Engineer)

> "Teams ask for a 'small database' without realizing they're asking for something that costs $2000/month and has no backup strategy." - Jordan (Mid-level Infrastructure Engineer)

### 2. **Infrastructure as Code Consistency and Standards** - Journey Steps 5-6: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** Every infrastructure change and new project setup  
- **Time Lost:** 60% longer development time due to inconsistent IaC practices  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
Different engineering teams use different Infrastructure as Code tools, patterns, and standards. This creates operational complexity, security gaps, and makes it difficult to maintain infrastructure at scale.

**Current Challenges:**
- Teams using mix of Terraform, CloudFormation, CDK, and manual AWS console changes
- No standardized modules or patterns for common infrastructure needs
- Inconsistent tagging, naming conventions, and resource organization
- Difficult to audit and maintain infrastructure created by different teams

**Team Quotes:**
> "Every team has their own special snowflake way of deploying infrastructure. It's a nightmare to maintain." - Casey (Senior Cloud Engineer)

> "We have 47 different ways to deploy a web application across our engineering teams. There should be one good way." - Morgan (Mid-level Infrastructure Engineer)

### 3. **Cloud Cost Management and Optimization** - Journey Steps 11-17: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Monthly cost reviews reveal ongoing waste and optimization opportunities  
- **Time Lost:** 20-25% of infrastructure team time on cost investigation and optimization  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
Engineering teams lack visibility into cloud costs and don't understand the cost implications of their infrastructure decisions. This leads to significant cloud waste and requires constant manual intervention from the infrastructure team.

**Current Challenges:**
- No cost visibility at the team or project level
- Engineering teams over-provisioning resources "to be safe"
- Lack of automated cost optimization (right-sizing, scheduling, reserved instances)
- No clear ownership model for cloud costs across teams

**Team Quotes:**
> "We found a staging environment that's been running 24/7 for 8 months costing $5000/month that nobody knew existed." - Riley (Junior Infrastructure Engineer)

> "Teams deploy infrastructure and forget about it. We're the ones who get the bill and have to figure out what can be optimized." - Taylor (Infrastructure Manager)
