# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary - Platform Engineering Team

**Team:** Platform Engineering Team  
**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Participants:** 8 platform engineers (2 Staff, 3 Senior, 2 Mid-level, 1 Junior) + 1 Platform PM  
**Facilitator:** Rachel Kim (Staff Platform Engineer)  

## Top Pain Points Identified (From Platform Team Perspective)

### 1. **Platform Adoption and Discoverability** - Journey Steps 1-3: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Continuous challenge across all engineering teams  
- **Time Lost:** 25-30% of platform engineering time spent on user support and adoption  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Engineering teams often don't know what platform services exist or how to use them effectively. This leads to duplicate tooling, inconsistent practices, and low ROI on platform investments.

**Current Challenges:**
- No centralized service catalog or documentation portal
- Platform capabilities are distributed across multiple tools and wikis
- Word-of-mouth knowledge sharing that doesn't scale
- Teams building custom solutions for problems platform already solves

**Team Quotes:**
> "I built this amazing deployment automation tool, but half the teams are still deploying manually because they don't know it exists." - Kevin (Staff Platform Engineer)

> "We get the same questions over and over in Slack. There's got to be a better way to help teams discover what we've built." - Priya (Platform Product Manager)

### 2. **Feedback Collection and Prioritization** - Journey Steps 18-20: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** Ongoing struggle with roadmap planning  
- **Time Lost:** 20% of planning time due to unclear priorities and requirements  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
Collecting meaningful feedback from engineering teams and translating it into actionable platform improvements is inconsistent and time-intensive. We often build features that don't address real pain points.

**Current Challenges:**
- Feedback collection is ad-hoc and happens during incidents or escalations
- No systematic way to prioritize platform improvements across teams
- Difficulty quantifying the impact of platform changes on developer productivity
- Limited visibility into how teams actually use platform services

**Team Quotes:**
> "We built this monitoring dashboard that we thought would be amazing, but teams still use their homegrown solutions. We missed something in the requirements." - Lisa (Senior Platform Engineer)

> "I wish we had data on which platform features actually improve developer velocity versus just creating more complexity." - Michael (Junior Platform Engineer)

### 3. **Platform Service Reliability and Operations** - Journey Steps 15-17: Medium Impact
- **Frequency:** Daily operational overhead  
- **Time Lost:** 30-40% of engineering time on operational tasks vs. new development  
- **Impact Level:** Medium  

**Description:**
Platform services have become critical infrastructure for all engineering teams, but operating them reliably while continuing to innovate is challenging. Platform outages have high blast radius.

**Current Challenges:**
- Platform services are single points of failure for multiple engineering teams
- Balancing feature development with operational stability
- On-call burden is increasing as platform surface area grows
- Difficult to maintain SLAs while experimenting with new technologies

**Team Quotes:**
> "When our CI system goes down, all of engineering stops. The pressure to keep everything running 24/7 is intense." - Marcus (Senior Platform Engineer)

> "We spend so much time keeping the lights on that we barely have bandwidth for the innovative platform features teams are asking for." - Sarah (Mid-level Platform Engineer)
