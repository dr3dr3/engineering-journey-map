# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary

**Team:** Data Engineering Squad Gamma  
**Date:** September 30, 2025  
**Participants:** 4 engineers (2 Senior, 2 Mid-level) + 1 Data Scientist  
**Facilitator:** Priya Patel (Data Engineering Manager)  

## Top Pain Points Identified

### 1. **Data Pipeline Development and Testing** - Journey Steps 6 & 7: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Every new pipeline or major pipeline change  
- **Time Lost:** 3-5 days per pipeline for development and testing  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Developing and testing data pipelines locally is nearly impossible due to data volume and complexity. We end up testing with synthetic data that doesn't catch real-world edge cases, leading to production issues.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Using heavily sampled datasets that miss edge cases
- Testing primarily in staging with production-like data (risky)
- Manual data validation steps that take hours

**Team Quotes:**
> "I can't run a 2TB dataset on my laptop, so I test with 1000 rows and hope for the best." - Sam (Senior Data Engineer)

> "Our pipelines work fine with clean test data, but production data is messy and breaks everything." - Alex (Mid-level Data Engineer)

### 2. **Pipeline Failure Detection and Recovery** - Journey Step 15: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** 2-3 pipeline failures per week  
- **Time Lost:** 4-6 hours per incident for detection, diagnosis, and recovery  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
We often don't know when data pipelines fail until downstream consumers complain. When failures do occur, diagnosing the root cause and deciding on recovery strategy is time-consuming and stressful.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Manual monitoring of pipeline runs via Airflow UI
- Slack alerts that are often false positives or too late
- Manual data backfills that require careful coordination

**Team Quotes:**
> "I found out about yesterday's pipeline failure from the analytics team this morning. They couldn't generate their reports." - Jordan (Senior Data Engineer)

> "Half my time is spent babysitting data pipelines instead of building new features." - Taylor (Mid-level Data Engineer)

### 3. **Data Quality and Validation** - Journey Step 9: Medium Impact
- **Frequency:** Ongoing with every pipeline run  
- **Time Lost:** 2-3 hours per week for manual data quality checks  
- **Impact Level:** Medium  

**Description:**
Data quality issues are detected too late in the process, often after data has already been consumed by downstream systems. We lack automated validation that can catch schema changes, data drift, and anomalies.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Manual spot-checking of data samples
- Custom validation scripts that are inconsistently applied
- Downstream system errors as early warning system (not ideal)

**Team Quotes:**
> "We're basically playing whack-a-mole with data quality issues. Fix one, and three more pop up." - Sam (Senior Data Engineer)

> "I wish I knew when the upstream API changed their schema before my pipeline started failing." - Chris (Data Scientist)

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### High Impact Quick Wins:
1. **Pipeline Testing Framework** - Ability to test pipelines with representative data subsets
2. **Data Pipeline Observability** - Real-time monitoring with intelligent alerting
3. **Schema Evolution Detection** - Automated detection of upstream data changes

### Strategic Investments:
1. **Data Development Environments** - Cloud-based environments for pipeline development and testing
2. **Automated Data Quality Platform** - Comprehensive data validation and anomaly detection
3. **Data Lineage and Impact Analysis** - Understanding downstream effects of data changes

### Process Improvements:
- Standardized data quality checks across all pipelines
- Automated recovery procedures for common failure scenarios
- Data SLA monitoring and alerting

## Journey Map Updates Needed

### New Pain Points:
- **Step 6.5**: "Data Pipeline Local Development" - Challenges of working with large datasets locally
- **Step 9.5**: "Automated Data Quality Validation" - Ensuring data meets quality standards before processing
- **Step 15.5**: "Data Pipeline Health Monitoring" - Comprehensive observability for data workflows

### Severity Updates:
- **Step 6 (Local Development)**: Increase complexity for data engineering workflows
- **Step 7 (QA Testing)**: Add data-specific testing challenges
- **Step 15 (Monitor)**: Expand to include data quality and pipeline health monitoring

### Missing Steps:
- Data discovery and cataloging processes
- Data lineage tracking and impact analysis
- Automated data backfill and recovery procedures

## Data-Specific Requirements

### Development Environment Needs:
- **Sample Data Management**: Automated generation of representative test datasets
- **Pipeline Testing Sandbox**: Isolated environments for testing data transformations
- **Data Versioning**: Track changes to datasets and pipeline outputs over time

### Monitoring and Alerting Needs:
- **Data Freshness Monitoring**: Alerts when data becomes stale
- **Schema Drift Detection**: Notification when upstream data formats change
- **Pipeline Performance Tracking**: Monitoring for pipeline execution time and resource usage

### Recovery and Reliability Needs:
- **Automated Backfill Capabilities**: Self-service data backfilling for failed pipeline runs
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns**: Automatically stop processing when data quality issues are detected
- **Data Rollback Mechanisms**: Ability to revert to previous good state when issues are found
