# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary

**Team:** Mobile Engineering Squad Delta  
**Date:** October 1, 2025  
**Participants:** 4 engineers (2 iOS, 2 Android) + 1 QA Engineer  
**Facilitator:** Jessica Wong (Mobile Engineering Lead)  

## Top Pain Points Identified

### 1. **Mobile-Specific CI/CD Pipeline Complexity** - Journey Steps 11-12: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Every release (weekly for iOS, bi-weekly for Android)  
- **Time Lost:** 4-6 hours per release for pipeline issues and troubleshooting  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Mobile CI/CD pipelines are significantly more complex than web deployments due to app store requirements, code signing, device testing, and platform-specific build processes. Pipeline failures are common and difficult to debug.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Manual builds and uploads when CI fails
- Local testing on limited device sets before pushing to CI
- Workaround scripts for common signing and provisioning issues

**Team Quotes:**
> "I spend more time fighting with certificates and provisioning profiles than actually developing features." - Maya (iOS Developer)

> "Our Android build works fine locally but fails in CI for reasons I can't reproduce." - Alex (Android Developer)

### 2. **Device Testing and Compatibility** - Journey Steps 7-9: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** Every feature development cycle  
- **Time Lost:** 1-2 days per feature for comprehensive device testing  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
Testing mobile apps across different devices, OS versions, and screen sizes is time-intensive. Our device lab is limited, and cloud testing solutions are expensive and slow.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Testing on personal devices (inconsistent coverage)
- Simulator testing that misses real device issues
- QA testing that happens too late in the development cycle

**Team Quotes:**
> "We have 3 physical test devices for iOS and probably need 15 to properly test our app." - Sam (iOS Developer)

> "Simulator testing is fast but doesn't catch performance issues or real device quirks." - Jordan (Android Developer)

> "By the time QA finds device-specific bugs, we're already planning the next release." - Riley (QA Engineer)

### 3. **API Integration and Backend Coordination** - Journey Step 8: Medium Impact
- **Frequency:** Every API change or new integration  
- **Time Lost:** 1-2 days for coordination and integration testing  
- **Impact Level:** Medium  

**Description:**
Mobile apps have different constraints and requirements than web apps, but backend teams often don't consider mobile-specific needs when designing APIs. This leads to inefficient API calls, battery drain, and poor user experience.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Mobile team creating wrapper APIs to optimize for mobile use cases
- Manual coordination with backend teams for mobile-friendly API design
- Client-side caching and optimization to work around inefficient APIs

**Team Quotes:**
> "The backend API returns 50 fields when we only need 5, and it's killing our app's performance." - Maya (iOS Developer)

> "I've had to build a local caching layer because the API doesn't support offline scenarios." - Alex (Android Developer)

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

- **Step 8.5**: "Mobile-Backend Integration" - Optimizing APIs for mobile constraints

### Severity Updates:
- **Step 11-12 (Deployment)**: Increase complexity rating for mobile-specific deployment challenges
- **Step 7-9 (Testing)**: Add mobile-specific testing requirements and constraints
- **Step 8 (Integration Testing)**: Include mobile-backend coordination challenges

### Missing Steps:
- App store submission and review processes
- Mobile app performance optimization and monitoring

### Development Environment Needs:
- **Simulator Management**: Automated setup and teardown of iOS/Android simulators
- **Device Provisioning**: Easy access to physical test devices
- **Cross-Platform Tooling**: Standardized development setup for React Native projects

### Monitoring and Analytics Needs:
- **Real User Monitoring**: Performance and crash reporting from production apps
- **API Usage Analytics**: Understanding how mobile apps consume backend services
- **Feature Flag Management**: Safe rollout of features to mobile users

## Platform Team Collaboration Areas

### Immediate Collaboration Needs:
