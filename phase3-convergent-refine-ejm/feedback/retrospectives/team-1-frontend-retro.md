# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary

**Team:** Frontend Squad Alpha  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Participants:** 6 engineers (2 Senior, 3 Mid-level, 1 Junior)  
**Facilitator:** Sarah Martinez (Engineering Manager)  

## Top Pain Points Identified

### 1. **Local Development Environment Setup** - Journey Step 5: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Every new project or when dependencies change  
- **Time Lost:** 4-8 hours per engineer per project  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Setting up local development environments is incredibly time-consuming and error-prone. Each project has different Node.js versions, package managers, and configuration requirements.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Slack channel dedicated to setup issues (#frontend-help-setup)
- Shared Google Doc with "known fixes" that's often outdated
- Senior developers helping juniors via screen sharing

**Team Quotes:**
> "I spent my entire first week just trying to get the development environment working. It shouldn't be that hard." - Alex (Junior Developer)

> "Every time we add a new microservice, it's another 2-3 hours of figuring out how to run it locally. I've started just testing everything in staging." - Jamie (Mid-level)

### 2. **Testing Environment Instability** - Journey Step 7: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** Daily  
- **Time Lost:** 2-3 hours per day team-wide  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
The shared QA testing environment goes down frequently, and when it's up, it's often in an unknown state from other teams' testing.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Testing directly in staging environment (risky)
- Coordinating with other teams via Slack before deploying to QA
- Keeping a "QA environment status" board updated manually

**Team Quotes:**
> "I've started calling QA environment 'the mystery box' because you never know what state it's going to be in." - Morgan (Senior Developer)

> "Half my standups are just 'blocked on QA environment being down again'." - Taylor (Mid-level)

### 3. **Deployment Process Complexity** - Journey Step 12: Medium Impact
- **Frequency:** Every release (2-3 times per week)  
- **Time Lost:** 30-45 minutes per deployment  
- **Impact Level:** Medium  

**Description:**
The deployment process requires too many manual steps and coordination with other teams. The Jenkins pipeline works but requires deep knowledge to troubleshoot when it fails.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Only 2 team members are "certified" to do deployments
- Written checklist that's 47 steps long
- Post-deployment verification takes another 15 minutes

**Team Quotes:**
> "I'm afraid to touch the deployment pipeline because I don't really understand what all those Jenkins steps are doing." - Alex (Junior Developer)

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### High Impact Quick Wins:
1. **Containerized Development Environments** - Docker Compose setup that works consistently across all projects
2. **Environment Status Dashboard** - Real-time status of all testing environments with last deployment info
3. **One-Click Deployment** - Simplified deployment process with automated verification

### Strategic Investments:
1. **Ephemeral Testing Environments** - Spin up isolated testing environments per feature branch
2. **Developer Environment as a Service** - Cloud-based development environments accessible via browser

### Process Improvements:
- Regular "environment health checks" automated and reported
- Better documentation with video walkthroughs for setup processes
- Deployment runbook automation with self-healing capabilities

## Journey Map Updates Needed

### New Pain Points:
- **Step 5.5**: "Managing Environment Drift" - Local environments becoming inconsistent over time
- **Step 7.5**: "Environment Coordination" - Coordinating shared testing resources across teams

### Severity Updates:
- **Step 5 (Local Setup)**: Increase from Medium to High impact
- **Step 7 (QA Testing)**: Increase from Medium to High impact

### Missing Steps:
- Environment troubleshooting and debugging processes
- Cross-team coordination workflows for shared resources

## Action Items

### Quick Wins (Target: 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Environment Status API** - Create simple API to check health of all environments (Kevin, Platform Team)
- [ ] **Setup Script Audit** - Review and update all project setup scripts (Sarah, Frontend Team)
- [ ] **Jenkins Pipeline Documentation** - Create visual guide for deployment process (Marcus, DevOps)

### Medium-term Improvements (Target: 1-3 months)
- [ ] **Docker Development Environments** - Containerize all frontend projects (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Automated Environment Reset** - Script to reset QA environment to known state (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Deployment Automation** - Reduce manual deployment steps by 50% (DevOps Team)

### Strategic Initiatives (Target: 3-6 months)
- [ ] **Feature Branch Environments** - Investigate and pilot ephemeral testing environments (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Cloud Development Environments** - Evaluate GitHub Codespaces or similar solutions (Platform Team)

### Platform Team Follow-up Required
- [ ] Research current solutions for frontend development environment standardization
- [ ] Cost analysis for ephemeral environment solutions
- [ ] Integration requirements for existing Jenkins pipelines

## Next Steps
- Share feedback with platform engineering team by October 1st
- Schedule follow-up retrospective for December 2025 to review progress
- Update team's journey map documentation with new pain points
- Plan platform team collaboration session for November 2025
