# Engineering Journey Map Retrospective Summary

**Team:** Backend Services Squad Beta  
**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Participants:** 5 engineers (3 Senior, 2 Mid-level)  
**Facilitator:** David Kumar (Tech Lead)  

## Top Pain Points Identified

### 1. **Service-to-Service Testing** - Journey Step 8: High Impact
- **Frequency:** Every feature that spans multiple services  
- **Time Lost:** 1-2 days per feature for integration testing  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:** 
Testing interactions between microservices is extremely difficult. We often don't discover integration issues until late in the development cycle because local testing doesn't catch service boundary problems.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Running 8+ services locally (kills developer laptops)
- Creating extensive mocking for all dependencies (time-intensive and brittle)
- Integration testing only in shared environments (slow feedback loop)

**Team Quotes:**
> "I have 32GB of RAM and it's still not enough to run our entire service ecosystem locally." - Jordan (Senior Engineer)

> "Half of our bugs are discovered during integration testing, which means we're basically doing waterfall development in a microservices world." - Casey (Senior Engineer)

### 2. **Database Migration and Schema Management** - Journey Step 11: High Impact  
- **Frequency:** Every release with database changes  
- **Time Lost:** 3-4 hours per migration  
- **Impact Level:** High  

**Description:**
Database migrations are scary and time-consuming. We spend a lot of time coordinating between teams to ensure migrations don't break other services, and rollback procedures are manual and error-prone.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Extensive pre-migration testing in staging (often catches issues late)
- Manual coordination via Slack and email before each migration
- Database snapshots before every migration (slow and storage-intensive)

**Team Quotes:**
> "Database migrations give me anxiety. There's always that moment of 'did I just break everything?'" - Riley (Mid-level Engineer)

> "We've had to rollback 3 migrations in the last month because we didn't anticipate how they'd affect other services." - Casey (Senior Engineer)

### 3. **Observability Gaps** - Journey Step 15: Medium Impact
- **Frequency:** During every incident investigation  
- **Time Lost:** 1-2 hours per incident for root cause analysis  
- **Impact Level:** Medium  

**Description:**
We have monitoring tools, but they don't give us the right level of detail when things go wrong. Correlation between different metrics is manual and time-consuming.

**Current Workarounds:**
- Manual log aggregation from multiple sources
- Custom scripts to correlate metrics across services
- Slack channels for real-time incident coordination

**Team Quotes:**
> "When something breaks, I spend more time trying to figure out what happened than actually fixing it." - Morgan (Mid-level Engineer)

> "Our metrics tell us something is wrong, but not why or where to look first." - Jordan (Senior Engineer)

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### High Impact Quick Wins:
1. **Service Testing Framework** - Lightweight testing framework for service interactions
2. **Migration Safety Checks** - Automated validation of database migrations against dependent services
3. **Distributed Tracing** - Implement end-to-end request tracing across services

### Strategic Investments:
1. **Service Mesh Implementation** - Istio or Linkerd for service communication and observability
2. **Contract Testing Platform** - Consumer-driven contract testing for service boundaries
3. **Database as a Service** - Managed database solutions with automated migration tooling

### Process Improvements:
- Service dependency mapping and impact analysis
- Standardized logging format across all services
- Automated rollback procedures for database migrations

## Journey Map Updates Needed

### New Pain Points:
- **Step 8.5**: "Cross-Service Integration Validation" - Testing service interactions before deployment
- **Step 11.5**: "Migration Impact Analysis" - Understanding downstream effects of schema changes
- **Step 15.5**: "Cross-Service Root Cause Analysis" - Tracking issues across service boundaries

### Severity Updates:
- **Step 8 (Integrated Testing)**: Increase complexity due to microservices architecture
- **Step 11 (Prepare Change)**: Add emphasis on database migration coordination
- **Step 15 (Monitor)**: Expand to include distributed system observability needs

### Missing Steps:
- Service dependency management and versioning
- Cross-team coordination protocols for breaking changes
- Automated service health checks and circuit breakers

## Specific Solution Requests

### Immediate Needs:
- **Service Test Environment**: Ability to spin up lightweight versions of dependent services for testing
- **Migration Dry-Run Tool**: Test database migrations against copies of production data
- **Alert Correlation Dashboard**: Single view showing related alerts across all services

### Future Desires:
- **Chaos Engineering Platform**: Controlled failure injection to test service resilience
- **Service Catalog**: Documentation and discovery tool for internal APIs
- **Automated Performance Testing**: Load testing that runs automatically on service changes

## Action Items

### Quick Wins (Target: 2-4 weeks)
- [ ] **Service Dependency Map** - Document current service interactions (David, Backend Team)
- [ ] **Migration Checklist Template** - Standardize pre-migration validation steps (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Log Format Standardization** - Implement structured logging across all backend services (All Backend Teams)

### Medium-term Improvements (Target: 1-3 months)
- [ ] **Contract Testing Pilot** - Implement Pact testing for 2-3 critical service pairs (Platform + Backend Teams)
- [ ] **Distributed Tracing Setup** - Implement Jaeger or similar solution (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Database Migration Automation** - Automated rollback and validation tooling (Platform Team)

### Strategic Initiatives (Target: 3-6 months)
- [ ] **Service Mesh Evaluation** - Research and pilot service mesh solutions (Platform Team)
- [ ] **Chaos Engineering Program** - Systematic resilience testing framework (SRE + Platform Teams)

### Platform Team Follow-up Required
- [ ] Requirements gathering for service testing framework
- [ ] Evaluation of existing contract testing solutions
- [ ] Cost-benefit analysis for service mesh implementation

## Next Steps
- Platform team consultation scheduled for October 5th
- Cross-team workshop on service testing strategies planned for October 15th
- Follow-up retrospective scheduled for January 2026
- Share learnings with other backend teams via engineering all-hands
