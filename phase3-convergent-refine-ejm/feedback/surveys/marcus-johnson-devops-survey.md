**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Time Spent:** 2-5 days  
**Pain Points:** 
- Hardware/software provisioning delays

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Onboarding is solid now after we automated most of it. The only remaining pain point is hardware procurement which is outside our control. Maybe standardized dev machine images could speed things up."*

### Step 2: Planning Work
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent:** 2-4 hours per sprint  
**Pain Points:**
- Poor visibility into dependencies
- Limited technical context in requirements

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Planning works well but product requirements rarely include operational considerations. Better templates that capture NFRs and operational impact would help."*

### Step 3: Architecture and Design
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Time Spent:** 4-8 hours per feature  
**Pain Points:**
- Inconsistent architectural standards

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Architecture discussions are comprehensive and include operational perspective. Standardized architecture decision records have helped maintain consistency."*

### Step 4: QA Pre-Development
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent:** 1-2 hours per feature  
**Pain Points:**
- Test environment availability and setup
- Dependency on external systems

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"QA planning is good but test environment orchestration is complex. Infrastructure-as-code for test environments has helped but we need better external service mocking."*

### Step 5: Local Setup
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Time Spent:** Less than 1 hour for new project  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Local setup is excellent now with our containerized development environments. One-command setup works reliably across different platforms."*

### Step 6: Local Development
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent on Tool Issues:** Less than 10%  
**Pain Points:**
- Slow test execution and feedback loops

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Development tooling is solid but integration tests are still slow. Better test parallelization and selective test execution based on code changes would help."*

### Step 7: QA Isolated
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Test Duration:** Less than 5 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Isolated testing is fast and reliable with our current CI pipeline setup. Good parallelization and caching strategies."*

### Step 8: QA Integrated
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Test Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- Complex environment orchestration
- Resource-intensive test environment requirements

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Integration testing works but environment orchestration is complex. Service mesh and better service virtualization would simplify this."*

### Step 9: QA User Acceptance
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Difficult environment access for business users
- Inconsistent test data for realistic scenarios

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"UAT environment access for business users is still clunky. Better self-service environment provisioning and realistic test data generation would improve the experience."*

### Step 10: QA Pre-Production
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Duration:** 2-8 hours  
**Pain Points:**
- Performance testing complexity and duration
- Manual verification checklists and approvals

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Pre-prod validation is thorough but some checks could be automated. Performance testing infrastructure is solid but test execution could be faster."*

### Step 11: Prepare Change
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Duration:** 2-8 hours  
**Pain Points:**
- Complex approval workflows and bureaucracy
- Manual coordination across multiple teams

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Change management has improved with automation but approval workflows are still bureaucratic. Risk-based automated approvals and better change impact analysis would streamline this."*

### Step 12: Deploy Production
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Duration:** Less than 15 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Production deployments are excellent now - fully automated, fast, and reliable. Blue-green deployments with automated rollback have eliminated most deployment risks."*

### Step 13: Release to Customers
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Duration:** Less than 1 day  
**Pain Points:**
- Manual rollout management and monitoring

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Feature rollouts work well but are mostly manual. Automated canary releases with metric-based promotion/rollback would reduce manual oversight."*

### Step 14: QA Production
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Detection Time:** Within 5 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Production validation is excellent with comprehensive monitoring and automated health checks. Quick detection and alerting on issues."*

### Step 15: Monitor
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Satisfaction:** Very satisfied - alerts are accurate and actionable  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Monitoring setup is excellent. Good balance of coverage without noise. Automated correlation and intelligent alerting work well."*

### Step 16: Observe and Support
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Response Time:** Less than 30 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Incident response is well-orchestrated with good automation and runbooks. Response times are excellent and post-incident reviews drive continuous improvement."*

### Step 17: Assess and Feedback
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Feedback Frequency:** Weekly  
**Pain Points:**
- Manual feedback analysis and synthesis processes
- Limited user analytics and behavior tracking

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"We get good operational feedback but customer usage analytics could be better. More comprehensive user behavior tracking and automated feedback analysis would provide better insights."*

### Step 18: Manage Tech Debt
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Allocation:** 20-30%  
**Pain Points:**
- Poor tooling for identifying and tracking technical debt
- Complex refactoring in legacy systems

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Tech debt management is decent but identification is still mostly manual. Better automated code quality analysis and tech debt scoring would help prioritize efforts."*

### Step 19: Grow Capabilities
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Learning Time:** 4-8 hours per week  
**Pain Points:**
- Difficulty applying new skills in production work

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Learning opportunities are good but need more time to experiment with new technologies in production contexts. Innovation sprints or dedicated experimentation time would help."*

### Step 20: Continuous Improvement
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)
