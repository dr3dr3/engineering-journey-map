**Duration:** 3-5 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Limited stakeholder availability for testing
- Unclear acceptance criteria and success metrics

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"UAT timing is unpredictable because stakeholders are busy. Better upfront criteria definition and maybe async testing tools would help."*

### Step 10: QA Pre-Production
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Performance testing complexity and duration
- Security scanning and compliance validation delays

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Pre-prod validation is thorough but slow. Performance tests take forever and security scans often find minor issues that block releases. Better integration of security scanning in development would catch issues earlier."*

### Step 11: Prepare Change
**Overall Experience:** Poor (2)  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Complex approval workflows and bureaucracy
- Manual coordination across multiple teams
- Unclear rollback and risk mitigation procedures

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Change management is bureaucratic and slows us down. Too many approvals for routine changes. Risk-based change categorization and automated approvals for low-risk changes would help."*

### Step 12: Deploy Production
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Duration:** 15-60 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- Poor deployment monitoring and feedback
- Coordination challenges across teams during deployment

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Deployments are mostly automated but we need better monitoring during deployments. Hard to know if a deployment succeeded until users start complaining."*

### Step 13: Release to Customers
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Duration:** 1-3 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Limited A/B testing and experimentation tools
- Manual rollout management and monitoring

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Feature rollouts work but are mostly manual. Better feature flag management and automated rollout policies based on metrics would reduce manual oversight."*

### Step 14: QA Production
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Detection Time:** 5-15 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- Manual verification processes
- Inadequate synthetic and user journey testing

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Production validation catches most issues quickly but relies too much on manual checks. Better synthetic testing and automated user journey validation would improve confidence."*

### Step 15: Monitor
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Satisfaction:** Satisfied - mostly works but some noise  
**Pain Points:**
- Poor correlation between different monitoring systems
- Complex dashboard configuration and maintenance

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Monitoring tools work but we have too many of them. Correlating issues across different dashboards is painful. A unified observability platform would be much better."*

### Step 16: Observe and Support
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Response Time:** 30 minutes - 2 hours  
**Pain Points:**
- Complex escalation procedures and on-call management
- Difficulty accessing production systems and logs

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Incident response is solid but on-call rotation is wearing people out. Better automation for common issues and more efficient log access would reduce MTTR."*

### Step 17: Assess and Feedback
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Feedback Frequency:** Monthly  
**Pain Points:**
- Difficulty correlating feedback with technical implementation
- Communication gaps between customer-facing and technical teams
