### Step 2: Planning Work
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent:** 2-4 hours per sprint  
**Pain Points:**
- Poor visibility into dependencies
- Integration complexity not well understood

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Planning works well but reliability requirements are often overlooked until late in the process. Better integration of SLO planning and reliability engineering in sprint planning would prevent issues."*

### Step 3: Architecture and Design
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Time Spent:** 1-2 days per feature  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Architecture reviews now consistently include reliability and observability considerations. The architecture decision records process has been excellent for maintaining institutional knowledge."*

### Step 4: QA Pre-Development
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent:** 2-4 hours per feature  
**Pain Points:**
- Dependency on external systems

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"QA planning is good but we need better chaos engineering integration in the test planning phase. Reliability testing should be planned upfront, not bolted on later."*

### Step 5: Local Setup
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent:** 1-4 hours for new project  
**Pain Points:**
- Resource consumption and performance issues

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Local setup works well but running full observability stacks locally is resource-intensive. Better lightweight alternatives or cloud-based development environments for reliability testing would help."*

### Step 6: Local Development
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Spent on Tool Issues:** 10-25%  
**Pain Points:**

**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Test Duration:** 5-15 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- Limited test automation and manual effort
- Environment drift from production

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Isolated testing doesn't capture reliability concerns well. Need better integration of reliability testing in the isolated test phase, including resource limits and failure injection."*

### Step 8: QA Integrated
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Test Duration:** 15-30 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- Limited visibility into cross-service interactions
- Resource-intensive test environment requirements

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Integration testing captures most reliability issues but visibility into service dependencies could be better. Service mesh observability in test environments would help identify potential production issues."*

### Step 9: QA User Acceptance
**Overall Experience:** Average (3)  
**Duration:** 1-2 days  
**Pain Points:**
- Unclear acceptance criteria and success metrics

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"UAT rarely includes reliability and performance acceptance criteria. Better integration of SLOs and performance benchmarks in UAT would catch more issues before production."*

### Step 10: QA Pre-Production
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Duration:** 2-8 hours  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Pre-production validation is comprehensive and catches most reliability issues. Load testing, chaos engineering, and performance validation are well integrated."*

### Step 11: Prepare Change
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Duration:** 2-8 hours  
**Pain Points:**
- Manual coordination across multiple teams

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Change management includes good risk assessment but coordination across teams during major changes could be better automated. Better change impact analysis and automated communication would help."*

### Step 12: Deploy Production
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Duration:** Less than 15 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Production deployments are excellent with comprehensive monitoring and automated rollback. Canary deployments with SLO-based promotion work very well."*

### Step 13: Release to Customers
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Duration:** Less than 1 day  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Feature rollouts are well-monitored with good SLO tracking and automated rollback. Feature flags with reliability circuit breakers work excellently."*

### Step 14: QA Production
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Detection Time:** Within 5 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Production validation is comprehensive with excellent synthetic monitoring and real user monitoring integration. Quick detection and automated response work well."*

### Step 15: Monitor
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Satisfaction:** Very satisfied - alerts are accurate and actionable  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Monitoring and alerting are excellent with good signal-to-noise ratio. Intelligent alerting based on SLO burn rates has eliminated most alert fatigue while maintaining quick incident detection."*

### Step 16: Observe and Support
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Response Time:** Less than 30 minutes  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Incident response is well-orchestrated with excellent runbooks, automation, and post-incident review processes. MTTR has improved significantly with better tooling and processes."*

### Step 17: Assess and Feedback
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Feedback Frequency:** Weekly  
**Pain Points:**
- Manual feedback analysis and synthesis processes

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"We get good operational feedback and reliability metrics, but customer impact analysis could be more automated. Better correlation between reliability metrics and customer satisfaction would help prioritize improvements."*

### Step 18: Manage Tech Debt
**Overall Experience:** Good (4)  
**Time Allocation:** 20-30%  
**Pain Points:**
- Complex refactoring in legacy systems

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Tech debt management includes reliability concerns but legacy system improvements are challenging. Better tooling for reliability impact analysis of technical debt would help prioritize efforts."*

### Step 19: Grow Capabilities
**Overall Experience:** Excellent (5)  
**Learning Time:** 4-8 hours per week  
**Pain Points:**
- None significant

**Improvement Suggestions:** *"Learning opportunities are excellent with good access to reliability engineering resources, conferences, and experimentation time. The chaos engineering practice group has been particularly valuable."*
