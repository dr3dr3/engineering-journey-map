# Jobs-to-be-Done Priority Matrix

This matrix combines stakeholder "push" priorities (X-axis) and engineer "pull" priorities (Y-axis) to identify the most critical jobs-to-be-done for platform engineering initiatives.

## Matrix Analysis

### High Push, High Pull (Top Right - Critical Priority)
- **Transition manual to automated testing**
  - Both stakeholders and engineers prioritize this as #1
  - Perfect alignment indicates this should be the primary focus

### High Push, Low Pull (Bottom Right - Stakeholder Driven)
- **Quick organizational onboarding**
  - High priority for stakeholders (#3)
  - Not mentioned by engineers (assumed low priority)
  - Important for business outcomes but may need engineer buy-in

### Low Push, High Pull (Top Left - Engineer Driven)  
- **Systematic technical debt management**
  - High priority for engineers (#2)
  - Not mentioned by stakeholders (assumed low priority)
  - Critical for long-term technical health

### High Push, Medium Pull (Center Right - Balanced Priority)
- **Safe deployment to multiple environments**
  - High priority for stakeholders (#2)
  - Medium priority for engineers (#3)
  - Good alignment for implementation

### Low Push, Low Pull (Bottom Left - Lower Priority)
- **Reliable local development environment**
  - Low priority for stakeholders (not mentioned)
  - Medium-low priority for engineers (#4)
  - Important for developer productivity but lower strategic impact

## Recommended Action Plan

Based on this matrix analysis:

1. **Immediate Focus**: Transition manual to automated testing (perfect alignment)
2. **Strategic Balance**: Safe deployment to multiple environments (good alignment)
3. **Technical Investment**: Systematic technical debt management (critical for engineers)
4. **Business Investment**: Quick organizational onboarding (critical for stakeholders)
5. **Foundation**: Reliable local development environment (supportive capability)

## Notes

- Items not explicitly mentioned in either priority list were assigned "low" priority
- The matrix helps identify areas where stakeholder and engineer priorities align or diverge
- Perfect alignment on automated testing suggests this should be the primary platform engineering initiative
