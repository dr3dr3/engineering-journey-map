- **3-4 week time to productivity** longer than industry standard due to complexity
- **Low onboarding satisfaction** (2.8/5) indicating significant improvement opportunities
- **Information overload** with 60 repositories, multiple environments, and extensive tooling
- **Support burden** - 50% of first-week support tickets are access and context-related
- **Unclear direction** between current state practices and future state goals

## The Struggling Moment

### Primary Struggle Scenario
**"I'm three days into my new job and I'm completely overwhelmed. I have access to dozens of systems I don't understand, documentation for 60 different repositories, and everyone keeps mentioning things like 'the testing transformation' and 'technical debt initiatives' without explaining what they mean or how they affect my daily work. I spent two hours trying to get my BitBucket access working, and when I finally got into the code, I realized I don't understand which practices I should follow—are we doing things the old way while we transition, or should I jump straight to the new approaches? I want to contribute and make a good impression, but I feel like I'm drinking from a fire hose, and I'm afraid to ask too many questions because I don't want to seem incompetent. Meanwhile, I'm supposed to start working on actual features, but I don't have enough context to know if what I'm doing aligns with where the organization is heading."**

### Emotional Journey of the Struggle
1. **Initial Excitement** - "I'm excited to start contributing to this new team and organization"
2. **Information Overwhelm** - "There's so much to learn, I don't know where to start"
3. **Access Frustration** - "Why is it taking so long to get basic access to systems?"
4. **Direction Confusion** - "I don't understand which practices to follow or why"
5. **Competence Anxiety** - "I should be able to figure this out, but I'm struggling"
6. **Social Hesitation** - "I don't want to bother people with too many questions"
7. **Contribution Urgency** - "I need to start adding value, but I don't have enough context"
8. **Alignment Uncertainty** - "Am I working toward the right goals and objectives?"
