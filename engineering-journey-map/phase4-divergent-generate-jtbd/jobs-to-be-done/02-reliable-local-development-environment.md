# Jobs-to-be-Done: Establish Reliable Local Development Environment with Production Parity

## Job Statement

**"When I'm developing software features, I want to establish a reliable local development environment that closely mirrors production, so I can develop and test confidently knowing that what works locally will work in production, without spending excessive time on environment setup and troubleshooting."**

## Context and Situation

### Current Organizational Challenge
- **Environment parity issues** - non-production environments don't reflect production reality
- **Complex multi-environment setup** (Production, Staging, UAT, ENG 1-7)
- **40+ microservices** with complex inter-service dependencies
- **16 hours average** for complete environment setup
- **40% of platform team support time** spent on local environment issues
- **20% reduction in development velocity** due to environment problems

### Target Transformation
- **One-click environment setup** through automation and containerization
- **95% environment parity** between local, staging, and production
- **60% reduction in environment setup time** through improved processes
- **Self-service environment management** reducing support burden

## The Struggling Moment

### Primary Struggle Scenario
**"I need to work on a feature that involves three different microservices, but setting up my local environment to run all the dependencies is a nightmare. The Docker setup instructions are outdated, the database seeding takes hours, and even when I get everything running, the behavior is completely different from what happens in production because the data is wrong and the configurations don't match. I've already spent two days just trying to get a working development environment, and I haven't written a single line of feature code yet. Meanwhile, I'm getting pressure to deliver, and I'm afraid that when I do get something working locally, it will break in production because my environment doesn't match."**

### Emotional Journey of the Struggle
1. **Initial Optimism** - "This should be straightforward, I'll just follow the setup docs"
2. **Growing Frustration** - "Why isn't this working? The instructions must be wrong"
3. **Overwhelm** - "There are so many moving pieces, I don't know where the problem is"
4. **Helplessness** - "I need help, but I feel like I should be able to figure this out"
5. **Time Pressure Anxiety** - "I'm falling behind on my actual work because of environment issues"
6. **Production Fear** - "Even if I get this working, will it actually work in production?"
7. **Tool Fatigue** - "I'm spending more time fighting with tools than writing code"

### Specific Pain Points and Friction

**Service Dependency Complexity**
- **Resource consumption** - local setup of 40+ microservices overwhelms development machines
- **Version compatibility issues** between services developed by different squads
- **Network configuration challenges** for inter-service communication
- **Database setup complexity** - multiple databases with inconsistent seeding processes

**Environment Configuration Drift**
- **Outdated documentation** that doesn't reflect current service configurations
- **Manual configuration steps** that are error-prone and time-consuming
- **Environment-specific variations** that aren't documented or automated
- **Infrastructure differences** between local Docker and cloud AWS environments

**Data and Testing Challenges**
- **Inadequate test data** that doesn't reflect production scenarios
- **Manual data seeding** that's time-consuming and inconsistent
- **Customer customization complexity** difficult to replicate locally
- **Production debugging impossible** due to environment differences

## Functional, Emotional, and Social Dimensions

### Functional Job Dimensions
**What I need to accomplish:**
- **Set up complete development environment** with all required services and dependencies
- **Configure realistic test data** that enables meaningful development and testing
- **Establish reliable build and run processes** for consistent development experience
- **Integrate development tools** (IDE, debugger, testing frameworks) with local environment
- **Maintain environment consistency** as services and configurations evolve

### Emotional Job Dimensions
**How I want to feel:**
- **Confident** that local development accurately reflects production behavior
- **Productive** spending time on feature development rather than environment wrestling
- **Independent** able to resolve environment issues without constant support
- **Secure** knowing that local testing provides reliable production predictions
- **Focused** on coding rather than infrastructure and tooling problems

### Social Job Dimensions
**How I want to be perceived:**
- **Self-sufficient developer** who doesn't constantly need environment support
- **Productive contributor** who delivers features rather than fighting tools
- **Reliable team member** whose local testing catches issues before production
- **Technical professional** who understands and manages development infrastructure
- **Collaborative colleague** who contributes to environment improvements for the team

## The Four Forces of Progress

### Push Forces (Away from current state)
**Strong Push Factors:**
- **Environment setup frustration** - excessive time and effort for basic development setup
- **"Works on my machine" failures** - local success followed by production failures
- **Support dependency** - constantly needing help with environment issues
- **Development velocity impact** - environment problems slowing feature delivery
- **Quality confidence loss** - inability to trust local testing results

**Organizational Push:**
- **Support burden** - platform team overwhelmed with environment support requests
- **Development inefficiency** - teams spending development time on infrastructure
- **Quality issues** - production problems that weren't caught locally

### Pull Forces (Toward new solution)
**Strong Pull Factors:**
- **Containerization promise** - Docker providing consistent, portable environments
- **Infrastructure-as-Code appeal** - automated, version-controlled environment setup
- **Self-service capability** - independence from support team dependencies
- **Production parity confidence** - accurate local representation of production behavior
- **Modern development practices** - industry-standard development environment approaches

**Tool and Process Appeal:**
- **One-click setup scripts** providing immediate productivity
- **Automated environment provisioning** eliminating manual configuration errors

- **Setup avoidance** - minimizing environment changes to avoid setup pain

**Organizational Habits:**
- **Squad-specific solutions** - each team developing custom environment approaches
- **Documentation debt** - accepting outdated setup instructions as inevitable
- **Support-first mentality** - defaulting to asking for help rather than self-service
