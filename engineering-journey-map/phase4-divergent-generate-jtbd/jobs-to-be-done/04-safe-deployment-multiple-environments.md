# Jobs-to-be-Done: Deploy Changes Safely Across Multiple Customer Instances and Environments

## Job Statement

**"When I'm ready to deploy my feature changes to production, I want to safely deploy across multiple customer instances and environments with confidence, so I can deliver value to customers without causing service disruptions or requiring complex rollback procedures."**

## Context and Situation

### Current Organizational Challenge
- **Multiple customized production instances** for specific customers requiring different configurations
- **Complex multi-environment deployment** (Production, Staging, UAT, ENG 1-7)
- **15% rollback rate** for deployments due to environment-specific issues
- **4-6 hour deployment windows** with up to 12 hours for complex releases
- **25% of engineering time** spent on deployment-related coordination and activities
- **30% of deployments** result in some customer-reported issues

### Target Transformation
- **Automated deployment processes** reducing manual coordination overhead
- **Progressive rollout capabilities** using feature flags for risk mitigation
- **Reduced deployment time** from 4-6 hours to 1-2 hours for standard releases
- **Improved deployment success rate** with <5% rollback requirement

## The Struggling Moment

### Primary Struggle Scenario
**"I've completed my feature and it's tested, but now I need to deploy it to production. The problem is we have five different customer instances, each with their own customizations, plus multiple environments that all need to be coordinated. I need to schedule with IT Operations, coordinate with other squads who might have conflicting changes, prepare different configuration files for each customer instance, and then monitor the deployment across all environments hoping nothing breaks. Last time I deployed, customer instance 3 had an issue that didn't show up in any of our testing environments, and we had to spend 6 hours rolling back while customers were affected. I'm anxious about this deployment because even though everything works in staging, I know there's a good chance something will go wrong in production that we didn't anticipate."**

### Emotional Journey of the Struggle
1. **Completion Excitement** - "My feature is done and tested, ready to go live!"
2. **Coordination Anxiety** - "This deployment process is so complex, what if I miss something?"
3. **Environment Uncertainty** - "Will this work the same way in all production environments?"
4. **Customer Impact Fear** - "What if this breaks something for specific customers?"
5. **Process Overwhelm** - "There are so many steps and approvals required"
6. **Rollback Dread** - "If something goes wrong, the rollback process is a nightmare"
7. **Professional Responsibility Stress** - "Customers are depending on this working correctly"

### Specific Pain Points and Friction

**Customer Customization Complexity**
- **Environment-specific configurations** that must be prepared and validated individually
