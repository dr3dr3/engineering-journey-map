# Current State Documentation Templates - Usage Guide

## Overview

This collection of templates provides a systematic approach to documenting your organization's current state for creating a tailored Engineering Journey Map. Each template focuses on a specific aspect of your engineering organization and development processes.

## Template Collection

### Core Templates (Start Here)
1. **[01-technical-environment.md](./01-technical-environment.md)** - Technical landscape and architecture
2. **[02-development-workflows.md](./02-development-workflows.md)** - How work flows from idea to production
3. **[05-pain-points.md](./05-pain-points.md)** - Current friction and challenges
4. **[09-metrics-kpis.md](./09-metrics-kpis.md)** - Baseline measurements and KPIs

### Organizational Templates
5. **[03-team-structure.md](./03-team-structure.md)** - Team organization and roles
6. **[07-skills-capabilities.md](./07-skills-capabilities.md)** - Current skills and capability gaps
7. **[06-culture-behavior.md](./06-culture-behavior.md)** - Cultural patterns and behaviors

### Contextual Templates
8. **[04-tools-systems.md](./04-tools-systems.md)** - Complete toolchain inventory
9. **[08-business-context.md](./08-business-context.md)** - Business requirements and constraints
10. **[10-stakeholder-perspectives.md](./10-stakeholder-perspectives.md)** - Views from different stakeholders

## Recommended Approach

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)
**Priority Order:**
1. **Business Context** (Template 8) - Understand constraints and priorities first
2. **Technical Environment** (Template 1) - Map the technical landscape
3. **Development Workflows** (Template 2) - Understand how work gets done
4. **Pain Points** (Template 5) - Identify current friction points

**Why this order?** Business context provides the framework for understanding everything else. Technical environment and workflows show the current reality, while pain points reveal what needs fixing.

### Phase 2: Deep Dive (Week 3-4)
**Priority Order:**
5. **Team Structure** (Template 3) - Understand who does what
6. **Tools & Systems** (Template 4) - Catalog the complete toolchain
7. **Metrics & KPIs** (Template 9) - Establish baseline measurements

**Why this order?** Now you understand the foundation, dive deeper into organizational structure, tooling ecosystem, and establish measurable baselines.

### Phase 3: Insights (Week 5-6)
**Priority Order:**
8. **Stakeholder Perspectives** (Template 10) - Gather different viewpoints
9. **Skills & Capabilities** (Template 7) - Assess team capabilities
10. **Culture & Behavior** (Template 6) - Understand informal patterns

**Why this order?** With the technical and organizational understanding complete, gather human insights to understand the full picture.

## Data Collection Strategies

### 1. Observational Data
- **Workflow Analysis**: Shadow developers for a day
- **Meeting Observations**: Attend standups, planning, retrospectives
- **Process Mapping**: Map actual vs documented processes
- **Tool Usage Monitoring**: Analyze logs and usage patterns

### 2. Interview Data
- **Individual Interviews**: 30-60 minutes with key people
- **Focus Groups**: 6-8 people discussing specific topics
- **Walking Interviews**: Talk while observing actual work
- **Exit Interviews**: Gather insights from departing team members

### 3. Survey Data
- **Anonymous Surveys**: For sensitive topics like culture and satisfaction
- **Skill Assessments**: Self-reported capability levels
- **Process Satisfaction**: Rate effectiveness of current processes
- **Tool Satisfaction**: Evaluate current toolchain

### 4. Quantitative Data
- **System Metrics**: Pull from monitoring and analytics tools
- **Process Metrics**: Extract from issue trackers and CI/CD systems
- **Business Metrics**: Gather from business intelligence systems
- **Historical Data**: Analyze trends over 6-12 months

## Tips for Effective Documentation

### Do's ✅
- **Be Specific**: Use numbers, examples, and concrete details
- **Capture Quotes**: Include verbatim feedback from stakeholders
- **Document Workarounds**: These reveal systemic issues
- **Note Frequency**: How often do problems occur?
- **Include Context**: Why do current practices exist?
- **Validate Findings**: Cross-reference multiple sources
- **Update Regularly**: This is a living document

### Don'ts ❌
- **Don't Assume**: Verify assumptions with data
- **Don't Judge**: Document reality, not ideal state
- **Don't Rush**: Thorough analysis takes time
- **Don't Work in Isolation**: Involve team members
- **Don't Ignore Politics**: Organizational dynamics matter
- **Don't Over-Generalize**: Specific teams may have unique situations

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. **Analysis Paralysis**
- Set time boundaries for each template
- Focus on 80/20 rule - capture the most important 80%
- Document "unknown" rather than guessing

### 2. **Survey Fatigue**
- Coordinate data collection across templates
- Use existing meetings for information gathering
- Make it easy for people to contribute

### 3. **Snapshot Bias**
- Current state may not be representative
- Ask about typical vs current situations
- Consider seasonal or cyclical variations

### 4. **Authority Bias**
- Senior voices may dominate perspective
- Ensure junior and mid-level input is captured
- Anonymous feedback channels are important

## Synthesis and Analysis

After completing templates, synthesize findings:

### 1. **Pattern Recognition**
- **Cross-Template Themes**: What issues appear in multiple templates?
- **Root Cause Analysis**: What underlying causes create multiple symptoms?
- **Correlation Analysis**: How do different factors influence each other?

### 2. **Priority Matrix**
Create a matrix of issues by:
- **Impact**: How much does this affect outcomes?
- **Frequency**: How often does this occur?
- **Difficulty**: How hard would this be to fix?

### 3. **Journey Mapping Alignment**
Map findings to your Engineering Journey Map phases:
- **Discovery & Onboarding**: What challenges do new developers face?
- **Development & Building**: Where are the workflow inefficiencies?
- **Testing & Validation**: What quality issues exist?
- **Deployment & Operations**: What operational pain points exist?

## Next Steps

Once templates are complete:

1. **Validate Findings** - Share summaries with key stakeholders
2. **Prioritize Issues** - Use impact/effort matrix to prioritize
3. **Map to Journey** - Align findings with Engineering Journey Map phases
4. **Create Action Plan** - Develop roadmap for improvements
5. **Establish Baseline** - Use metrics as starting point for measuring progress

## Questions or Issues?

If you encounter challenges while using these templates:
- **Missing Information**: Note gaps and plan follow-up data collection
- **Conflicting Data**: Document different perspectives and investigate
- **Overwhelming Detail**: Focus on high-impact areas first
- **Stakeholder Resistance**: Start with willing participants, build momentum

Remember: The goal is understanding, not perfection. A good current-state analysis with some gaps is better than a perfect analysis that never gets completed.
