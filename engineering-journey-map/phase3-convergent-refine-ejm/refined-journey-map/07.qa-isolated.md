# 7. QA Isolated
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

Testing individual features or changes in controlled environments separate from other components or dependencies.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we manage the test environment for isolated testing?
*   How do we get fast and reliable feedback from our automated tests?
*   How do we effectively debug and diagnose issues found during testing?

## Actions

*   Running a suite of automated tests (unit, integration, component) against a new build.
*   Performing manual exploratory testing on a new feature in a dedicated test environment.
*   Logging bugs in Jira with clear, detailed information.

## Challenges

*   Lack of good test data to cover all necessary scenarios.
*   Flaky tests that produce inconsistent results.
*   Difficulty setting up and managing isolated test environments.

## Interactions

*   **Quality Engineer:** Designing and executing the testing strategy for a feature.
*   **Engineering Team:** Fixing bugs found during testing and providing support for the test environment.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Providing and supporting the infrastructure for isolated test environments.

## Touchpoints

*   **CI/CD Pipeline (BitBucket pipelines):** Automatically running tests on every code change.
*   **Test Environment:** A dedicated, isolated environment for testing a specific feature or change.
*   **Test Automation Framework (Playwright):** Running automated end-to-end tests.

## Feeling

*   üò• **Frustrated:** When dealing with flaky tests or a difficult-to-reproduce bug.
*   üòå **Confident:** When a feature has been thoroughly tested and is working well.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working closely with developers to resolve issues.

## Opportunities

*   Invest in building a fast and reliable test automation suite.
*   Implement a strategy for managing test data effectively.
*   Use containerization to create lightweight, disposable test environments.

## Potential for AI

*   **Log Anomaly Detection:** AI models that can analyze logs from the test environment to identify unusual patterns that might indicate a problem.
*   **AI-Powered Test Selection:** An AI system that can intelligently select which tests to run based on the code changes, reducing test execution time.
*   **Flaky Test Detection:** AI tools that can analyze test results over time to identify and flag flaky tests.
