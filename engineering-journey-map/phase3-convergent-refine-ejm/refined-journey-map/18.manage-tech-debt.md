# 18. Manage Tech Debt
â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Systematically identifying, prioritizing, and addressing technical debt alongside feature development.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we make time for fixing technical debt when there is pressure to deliver new features?
- How do we identify and track technical debt to make it visible?
- How do we prevent technical debt from accumulating in the first place?

## Actions

- Identifying technical debt during code reviews, architectural discussions, or incident post-mortems.
- Creating tickets in Jira to track technical debt items and manage the backlog.
- Prioritizing technical debt based on its impact on system reliability, developer velocity, and the effort required to fix it.

## Challenges

- It's difficult to quantify and communicate the business value of fixing technical debt versus developing new features.
- There is constant pressure from the business to prioritize new features over non-functional work.
- The amount of existing technical debt across 60+ repositories feels overwhelming and it's hard to know where to start.

## Interactions

- **Engineering Team:** Responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and fixing technical debt within their squads.
- **Engineering Manager:** Advocates for allocating capacity to address tech debt and shields the team from pressure to only focus on features.
- **Product Manager:** Works with the engineering team to balance the roadmap between new features and managing technical debt.

## Touchpoints

- **Jira:** The backlog for tracking, prioritizing, and managing technical debt items.
- **SonarQube:** Used for automatically detecting code smells, security vulnerabilities, and other forms of technical debt.
- **BitBucket:** The codebase itself is the ultimate source of truth for technical debt, with pull requests being a key place to identify and discuss it.

## Feeling

- ðŸ˜¥ **Frustrated:** When you have to work around a piece of technical debt every day, slowing down feature development.
- ðŸ˜¬ **Worried:** About the long-term consequences of not addressing technical debt, such as production incidents or an inability to innovate.
- ðŸ’ª **Empowered:** When the team has the autonomy and dedicated time to manage its own technical debt.

## Opportunities

- Make technical debt visible by creating a dedicated backlog in Jira and tracking metrics over time.
- Establish a clear, data-driven process for prioritizing technical debt, using inputs from SonarQube and incident analysis.
- Invest in tools like SonarQube and provide training to help engineers write better, more maintainable code from the start.

## Potential for AI

- **AI-Powered Tech Debt Detection:** An AI system that can analyze the codebase in BitBucket and automatically identify complex areas of technical debt beyond what traditional static analysis tools can do.
- **Automated Refactoring:** AI tools that can automatically refactor code to fix common types of technical debt, reducing the manual effort for engineers.
- **Intelligent Prioritization:** An AI model that helps prioritize technical debt by predicting its impact on development velocity, bug rates, and system performance.
