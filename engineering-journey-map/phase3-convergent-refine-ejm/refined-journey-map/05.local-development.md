# 5. Local Development
â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Individual coding work, writing tests, debugging, and implementing features in isolation.

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we write clean, efficient, and maintainable code?
- How do we ensure our code is well-tested?
- How do we get fast feedback on our changes?

## Actions
- Writing code to implement new features or fix bugs.
- Writing unit tests and integration tests to verify the correctness of the code.
- Using a debugger to step through code and inspect its state.

## Challenges
- A slow or cumbersome local development environment. (2)
- Flaky tests that fail intermittently. (2)
- Difficulty reproducing bugs that occur in other environments.

## Interactions
- **Engineering Team:** Asking for help with a difficult problem, or discussing a technical approach.
- **Quality Engineer:** Clarifying testing requirements and acceptance criteria.
- **Code Reviewers:** Receiving feedback on pull requests.

## Touchpoints
- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** Writing, debugging, and testing code.
- **Source Code Repository:** Pushing and pulling changes, creating branches.
- **Local Application Stack:** Running the application and its dependencies locally.

## Feeling
- ðŸ’¡ **Creative:** Finding an elegant solution or a clever way to implement a feature. (2)
- ðŸ˜¥ **Frustrated:** When stuck on a bug or a difficult problem.
- ðŸ˜Œ **Satisfied:** After writing a clean piece of code or fixing a tricky bug.

## Opportunities
- Invest in optimizing the local development environment for speed and ease of use. (3)
- Use tools that provide real-time feedback on code quality and test coverage within the IDE. (3)
- Encourage the use of feature flags to decouple deployment from release. (2)

## Potential for AI
- **AI-Powered Code Completion:** Intelligent code completion tools that suggest lines or blocks of code as you type. (3)
- **Automated Test Generation:** AI tools that can automatically generate unit tests for a given piece of code. (2)
- **Real-time Code Quality Feedback:** An AI-powered linter that can provide more sophisticated feedback on code quality, style, and potential bugs in real-time. (1)
