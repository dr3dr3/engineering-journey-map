# 6. Code Review
‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Team-based technical decision making, code reviews, knowledge sharing, and cross-team coordination.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we effectively review each other's code to ensure quality and consistency?
*   How do we share knowledge and learn from each other to break down information silos?
*   How do we make technical decisions as a team in a collaborative way?

## Actions

*   Creating and submitting pull requests for review in BitBucket.
*   Reviewing pull requests from other team members, providing constructive feedback.
*   Participating in pair programming or mob programming sessions to solve complex problems together.

## Challenges

*   "Silos" of knowledge, where only one or two people understand a particular part of the system.
*   Difficulty scheduling time for pair programming or other collaborative activities.
*   Code reviews that are slow or superficial, leading to delays or missed issues.

## Interactions

*   **Engineering Team:** The primary group for collaboration, code reviews, and knowledge sharing.
*   **Engineering Manager:** Facilitating team discussions and helping to resolve conflicts.
*   **Other Engineering Teams:** Coordinating on cross-team projects and dependencies.

## Touchpoints

*   **BitBucket:** The central hub for code reviews via pull requests.
*   **SonarQube:** For static analysis, coding standards, and security scanning to automate initial feedback.
*   **Microsoft Teams:** For real-time discussions and knowledge sharing.

## Feeling

*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working together to achieve a common goal.
*   üôè **Supported:** Feeling that the team has your back and is there to help.
*   ü§ì **Curious:** Learning from the expertise and perspectives of others.

## Opportunities

*   Implement a system for rotating ownership of different parts of the codebase to spread knowledge.
*   Create a "blameless" culture where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities.
*   Establish clear guidelines and expectations for code reviews to improve speed and quality.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant:** An AI tool that can automatically review a pull request for common issues, style violations, and potential bugs, providing initial feedback before a human reviewer.
*   **Expert Finder:** An AI system that can identify subject matter experts on a particular topic within the organization based on their code contributions and documentation.
*   **Meeting Assistant:** Use Fellow.app to transcribe meetings, identify action items, and summarize key decisions from technical discussions.
