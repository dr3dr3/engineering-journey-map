# 19. Grow Capabilities
â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Developing individual and team skills through learning programs, mentorship, and knowledge sharing.

## Journey Step Focus
*   How do we support the career growth and development of every engineer?
*   How do we identify the skills that the team will need in the future?
*   How do we create a culture of continuous learning?

## Actions
*   Participating in formal training programs or workshops.
*   Participating in a mentorship program, either as a mentor or a mentee.
*   Creating a personal development plan with your manager.

## Challenges
*   Lack of time for learning and development due to project deadlines.
*   A culture that does not value or support learning.
*   Knowledge is concentrated in a few "experts," and there is no process for sharing it.

## Interactions
*   **Engineering Manager:** A key partner in an engineer's career development, providing coaching, feedback, and opportunities for growth.
*   **Mentor:** An experienced engineer who can provide guidance, support, and advice.
*   **Community of Practice:** A group of engineers from across the organization who are interested in a particular topic (e.g., front-end development, machine learning).

## Touchpoints
*   **Learning Management System (LMS):** A platform for accessing and tracking formal training.
*   **Internal Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** A place to share knowledge and best practices.
*   **Personal Development Plan (PDP):** A document that outlines an engineer's career goals and development plan.

## Feeling
*   ðŸ¤“ **Curious:** Eager to learn new things and expand your skills.
*   ðŸ’ª **Empowered:** Feeling that you have the support and resources you need to grow.
*   ðŸ˜¥ **Stuck:** Feeling that you are not learning or growing in your role.

## Opportunities
*   Dedicate a certain amount of time each week or sprint to learning and development.
*   Create a "community of practice" for key technologies or disciplines.
*   Build a culture that celebrates learning and knowledge sharing.

## Potential for AI
*   **AI-Powered Learning Recommendations:** An AI system that can recommend personalized learning resources (courses, articles, mentors) based on an engineer's skills, interests, and career goals.
*   **Skill Gap Analysis:** An AI model that can analyze the skills of a team and identify any gaps based on the future needs of the business.
*   **Intelligent Mentorship Matching:** An AI system that can match mentors and mentees based on their skills, experience, and personality.
