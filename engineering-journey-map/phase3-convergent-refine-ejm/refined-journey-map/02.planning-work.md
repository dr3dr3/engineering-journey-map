# 2. Planning Work
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ

Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we break down large initiatives into smaller, manageable pieces of work?
*   How do we estimate the effort required to complete the work?
*   How do we ensure we have a shared understanding of the work to be done?

## Actions

*   Breaking down user stories into smaller technical tasks.
*   Estimating the size or complexity of tasks using methods like story points.
*   Collaborating with Product Managers, Designers and Architects to clarify requirements and technical approach.

## Challenges

*   Underestimating the complexity of a task, leading to inaccurate timelines. (3)
*   Changing priorities mid-sprint, causing disruption and context switching. (2)
*   Vague or ambiguous requirements that are open to interpretation. (1)

## Interactions

*   **Product Manager:** Clarifying requirements, understanding business value, and negotiating scope.
*   **Architecture Team:** Collaborating on task breakdown, estimation, and technical approach.
*   **Engineering Team:** Collaborating on task breakdown, estimation, and technical approach.

## Touchpoints

*   **Issue Tracker (Jira):** Creating, updating, and organizing user stories and tasks.
*   **Product Management Tool (Aha):** Viewing the product roadmap and upcoming initiatives.
*   **Documentation Hub (Confluence):** Reading PRDs, ADRs and other planning documents.

## Feeling

*   ü§î **Thoughtful:** Analyzing requirements and thinking through technical implementation details. (3)
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working together with the team to create a plan. (2)
*   ü§∑ **Uncertain:** When requirements are unclear or constantly changing. (1)

## Opportunities

*   Implement a "Definition of Ready" to ensure stories are well-defined before they are considered for a sprint. (3)
*   Dedicate time for "spikes" or research tasks to de-risk complex work. (2)
*   Establish a clear process for handling and communicating priority changes. (1)

## Potential for AI

*   **Dependency Detection:** AI tools that can scan code and project boards to automatically identify potential dependencies between tasks or teams. (3)
*   **Automated Estimation:** AI models trained on historical data to suggest estimates for new tasks. (2)
*   **Meeting Summarization:** AI tools that can automatically generate summaries and action items from planning meetings.
