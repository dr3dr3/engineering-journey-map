# 11. Prepare Change
â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we formally document the change we are about to make in production?
*   How do we communicate the change to all relevant stakeholders?
*   How do we get the necessary approvals to proceed with the deployment?

## Actions

*   Writing a detailed description of the change, including the reason for the change, the expected impact, and the implementation plan.
*   Creating a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan, including pre-deployment checks, deployment steps, and post-deployment validation.
*   Developing a rollback plan in case the deployment fails.

## Challenges

*   The change management process is bureaucratic and slow.
*   The requirements for a change request are unclear or overly complex.
*   Getting timely approvals from all the required stakeholders.

## Interactions

*   **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** The formal body that reviews and approves change requests.
*   **Engineering Team:** Providing the technical details for the change request.
*   **Business Stakeholders:** Who need to be aware of the change and its potential impact on customers.

## Touchpoints

*   **Change Management System (e.g., Jira):** The system of record for all change requests.
*   **Implementation Plan Document:** A detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing the change.
*   **Rollback Plan Document:** A detailed, step-by-step guide for reverting the change if necessary.

## Feeling

*   ðŸ˜¥ Feeling concerned that the process is more about checking boxes than managing risk.
*   ðŸ˜¬ Waiting for approval, hoping that the change is not rejected.
*   ðŸ’ª Feeling confident that there is a solid plan in place for the deployment.

## Opportunities

*   Streamline the change management process for low-risk, routine changes.
*   Establish a "standard change" process for pre-approved, low-risk changes that do not require CAB approval.
*   Integrate the change management system with other tools (like the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring system) to provide more context and automation.

## Potential for AI

*   **Automated CAB Approval:** For low-risk changes, an AI system could automatically approve the change request if it meets all the predefined criteria.
*   **AI-Powered Change Request Generation:** An AI assistant that can automatically generate a draft change request based on the user stories and code changes in a release.
*   **Risk Assessment AI:** An AI model that can analyze a change request and predict its risk level based on historical data and the nature of the change.
