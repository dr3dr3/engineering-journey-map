# Engineering Journey Map: Step 11 - Knowledge Sharing & Community

## 1. Step Overview

### Purpose Statement
This step establishes comprehensive knowledge sharing practices and community building that accelerate organizational learning, reduce knowledge silos, and foster collaboration across the 5 engineering squads. Given our organizational challenges with inconsistent practices across squads, limited cross-team collaboration, and the need for better knowledge transfer to support our quality and automation initiatives, this phase emphasizes systematic knowledge capture, sharing, and community-driven continuous improvement.

### Entry Criteria
- Significant experience accumulated with technical debt management and system optimization
- Understanding of organizational improvement initiatives and best practices
- Established expertise in specific areas (testing, deployment, quality practices, etc.)
- Willingness to contribute to organizational learning and mentor others
- Time allocated for knowledge sharing and community building activities

### Exit Criteria
- This is an ongoing, continuous responsibility rather than discrete phase
- Success measured by:
  - Knowledge artifacts created and actively used across squads
  - Effective mentoring and knowledge transfer to other engineers
  - Cross-squad collaboration and practice standardization
  - Contribution to organizational learning and improvement initiatives
  - Community engagement and participation in knowledge sharing activities
