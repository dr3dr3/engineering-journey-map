# 12. Deploy to Production
â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Executing production deployments safely with minimal downtime and comprehensive validation.

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we deploy our changes to production reliably and consistently?
- How do we minimize the risk of a deployment causing a production issue?
- How do we quickly and safely roll back a deployment if something goes wrong?

## Actions
- Executing the deployment plan through an automated CI/CD pipeline (BitBucket Pipelines).
- Monitoring the progress of the deployment and looking for any errors or warnings using observability tools (Datadog).
- Performing post-deployment health checks and running automated smoke tests (Playwright) to verify the application is running correctly.

## Challenges
- Lack of visibility into the state of the production environment during and after the deployment. (3)
- Human error during a manual deployment process, which is slow and error-prone. (2)
- A deployment fails partway through, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.

## Interactions
- **Platform/DevOps Team:** Responsible for executing and monitoring the production deployment.
- **Engineering Team:** On standby to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the deployment.
- **IT Operations/NOC:** Monitoring the health of the system and responding to any alerts.

## Touchpoints
- **CI/CD Pipeline (BitBucket Pipelines):** The primary tool for automating deployments.
- **Monitoring and Alerting System (Datadog):** The key tool for validating the success of a deployment and detecting issues.
- **Production Environment (AWS):** The live environment where the code is deployed.

## Feeling
- ðŸ˜¬ **Focused:** Concentrating intently on the deployment process, ready to react to any issues.
- ðŸ˜¥ **Stressed:** When things go wrong and the pressure is on to fix them quickly.
- ðŸ˜Œ **Relieved:** After a successful deployment and all the health checks are green.

## Opportunities
- Automate the entire deployment process to make it faster, more reliable, and less error-prone. (3)
- Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy to reduce the risk of production deployments. (2)
- Build a comprehensive suite of automated health checks and smoke tests that run after every deployment. (2)

## Potential for AI
- **AI-Powered Deployment Validation:** An AI system that can analyze monitoring data (Datadog) after a deployment and automatically determine if it was successful or if a rollback is needed. (3)
- **Root Cause Analysis of Failed Deployments:** An AI system that can analyze the logs and other data from a failed deployment to identify the root cause of the failure.
- **Intelligent Rollback:** An AI assistant that can automatically trigger a rollback if it detects a problem, and can even suggest the safest way to roll back.
