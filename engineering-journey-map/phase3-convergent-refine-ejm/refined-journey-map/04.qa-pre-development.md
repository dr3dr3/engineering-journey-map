# 4. QA Pre-Development
‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we ensure we have the right test data and environments in place before development starts?
*   How do we create effective and comprehensive test cases that cover all critical scenarios and acceptance criteria?
*   How do we integrate testing into the development process from the very beginning to "shift-left"?

## Actions

*   Create a lightweight test plan within the Jira ticket that outlines the scope, approach, and testing activities required.
*   Collaborate with the Platform/DevOps team to ensure test environments are provisioned via Terraform and configured correctly.
*   Identify and prepare the necessary test data, automating its creation where possible to reflect production scenarios.

## Challenges

*   Difficulty in obtaining or creating realistic test data, which hinders the ability to replicate production scenarios.
*   Test environments are unstable, not representative of the production environment, and require manual effort to configure.
*   Insufficient time is allocated for test planning and preparation, leading to a rush and increased manual testing at the end of sprints.

## Interactions

*   **Quality Engineer:** Leads the test planning and strategy efforts, advocating for a "shift-left" approach.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Collaborates on provisioning and configuring consistent test environments using Terraform.
*   **Product Manager:** Clarifies requirements and acceptance criteria to ensure stories are well-defined and can be sliced into smaller items.

## Touchpoints

*   **TestRail:** Used for creating, organizing, and tracking test cases and linking them to requirements.
*   **Jira:** The central hub for linking test cases to user stories, managing test-related tasks, and tracking bugs found during planning.
*   **Playwright:** The primary framework for writing and managing automated end-to-end tests.

## Feeling

*   ü§î **Proactive:** Thinking about quality from the start and embedding it into the process, rather than treating it as an afterthought.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working closely with developers, product managers, and platform teams to build a shared understanding of quality.
*   üí™ **Prepared:** Feeling confident that a solid plan is in place to ensure a high-quality outcome and reduce future rework.

## Opportunities

*   Automate the provisioning of test environments using Terraform to make them more accessible, consistent, and potentially ephemeral.
*   Adopt a "shift-left" testing approach by defining test strategies and cases early, reducing the reliance on manual end-of-cycle testing.
*   Create a reusable library of test data that can be easily refreshed and automate the generation of new data needed for automated tests.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Test Case Generation:** An AI assistant that analyzes user stories in Jira to automatically generate comprehensive test cases.
*   **Test Data Generation:** AI tools that create realistic and varied test data, including edge cases, to better mirror the production environment.
*   **Acceptance Criteria Analysis:** AI tools that review acceptance criteria in Jira for clarity, completeness, and testability, aiding in the slicing of large stories.
