# 10. QA Pre-Production
‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions.

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we ensure that the software will work correctly in the production environment?
- How do we test the deployment process itself to ensure it is reliable?
- How do we validate the configuration of the production environment?

## Actions
- Deploying the release candidate to a staging or pre-production environment that is an exact replica of production.
- Running a full suite of automated regression tests to ensure no existing functionality has been broken.
- Conducting performance, load, and stress tests to ensure the application can handle expected traffic.

## Challenges
- The pre-production environment is not a true mirror of production, leading to missed issues. (3)
- Insufficient time for thorough testing before the release deadline.
- Difficulty in generating realistic load for performance testing.

## Interactions
- **Platform/DevOps Team:** Managing the pre-production environment and the deployment process.
- **Quality Engineer:** Leading the final testing efforts and providing a quality assessment.
- **Release Manager:** Coordinating the final stages of the release process.

## Touchpoints
- **Pre-production/Staging Environment:** A production-like environment for final testing.
- **CI/CD Pipeline (BitBucket pipelines):** Deploying the release candidate to the pre-production environment.
- **Configuration Management System (Terraform):** Verifying the environment configuration.

## Feeling
- üßê **Thorough:** Double-checking everything to ensure a smooth release. (3)
- üò¨ **Tense:** The final gate before a release, with high stakes.
- üí™ **Confident:** When all tests have passed and the team is ready for the release.

## Opportunities
- Use infrastructure-as-code to ensure that the pre-production environment is an exact replica of production. (3)
- Develop a "canary release" or "blue-green deployment" strategy to reduce the risk of production deployments. (2)
- Automate as much of the pre-production testing as possible to make it fast and repeatable. (1)

## Potential for AI
- **Configuration Drift Detection:** An AI system that can compare the configuration of the pre-production and production environments and flag any discrepancies. (3)
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** An AI system that can monitor the pre-production environment and automatically flag any unusual behavior or performance degradation.
- **Intelligent Release Risk Assessment:** An AI model that can analyze a release candidate and predict the likelihood of it causing a production issue.
