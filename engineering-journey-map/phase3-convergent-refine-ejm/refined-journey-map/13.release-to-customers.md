# 13. Release to Customers
‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Controlling feature rollouts to customers using feature flags and progressive release strategies.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we control the exposure of new features to customers?
*   How do we release a new feature to a small subset of users before a full rollout?
*   How do we quickly disable a feature if it's causing problems?

## Actions

*   Wrapping a new feature in a feature flag.
*   Configuring a feature flag to be enabled for a specific set of users (e.g., internal employees, beta testers, or a percentage of all users).
*   Monitoring key business and operational metrics as the feature is rolled out to more users.

## Challenges

*   Lack of a clear process for managing and communicating the state of feature flags.
*   The logic for the feature flag is complex and difficult to test.
*   Forgetting to remove old feature flags, leading to technical debt.

## Interactions

*   **Product Manager:** Deciding on the release strategy for a new feature and who should get it first.
*   **Engineering Team:** Implementing the feature flag and monitoring the release.
*   **Data Analyst:** Analyzing the data to measure the impact of the feature.

## Touchpoints

*   **Feature Flag Management System (e.g., LaunchDarkly, Optimizely):** The tool used to control the state of feature flags.
*   **Analytics Platform (e.g., Amplitude, Mixpanel):** The tool used to measure the impact of a feature on user behavior.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting System (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus):** The tool used to monitor the impact of a feature on system performance.

## Feeling

*   üò¨ **Cautious:** Carefully rolling out a new feature, watching the metrics closely.
*   üßê **Experimental:** Treating the release as an experiment, with a clear hypothesis and success metrics.
*   üòå **In Control:** Feeling confident that you can quickly disable a feature if something goes wrong.

## Opportunities

*   Establish a clear, standardized process for using and managing feature flags.
*   Use feature flags to enable "dark launching," where a feature is deployed to production but not visible to any users, allowing for final testing in the production environment.
*   Integrate the feature flag system with other tools, such as the issue tracker, monitoring system, and analytics platform.

## Potential for AI

*   **Automated Impact Analysis:** An AI model that can automatically analyze the impact of a new feature on a wide range of business and operational metrics, and flag any significant changes.
*   **AI-Powered Progressive Delivery:** An AI system that can automatically manage the rollout of a new feature, gradually increasing the percentage of users based on real-time monitoring of key metrics.
*   **Feature Flag Cleanup Bot:** An AI-powered bot that can automatically detect and create pull requests to remove old feature flags from the code.
