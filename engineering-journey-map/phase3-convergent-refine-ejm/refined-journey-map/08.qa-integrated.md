# 8. QA Integrated
‚òÖ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Testing how multiple components work together across services and systems.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we test end-to-end user flows that span multiple services?
*   How do we troubleshoot issues that only appear in an integrated environment?
*   How do we ensure that our changes work correctly with other parts of the system?

## Actions

*   Deploying changes to a shared, persistent integration testing environment.
*   Running a suite of end-to-end automated tests that simulate real user scenarios.
*   Troubleshooting issues in the integrated environment, which may involve looking at logs and metrics from multiple services.

## Challenges

*   Lack of realistic test data that covers all the necessary scenarios.
*   The integrated test environment is unstable or frequently broken.
*   It's hard to determine which service is the root cause of a failure.

## Interactions

*   **Other Engineering Teams:** The most critical interaction, requiring close coordination on deployments, testing, and troubleshooting.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Maintaining and supporting the integrated test environment.
*   **Quality Engineer:** Designing and executing the integration testing plan.

## Touchpoints

*   **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., BitBucket pipelines):** Deploying changes to the integrated environment.
*   **End-to-End Test Automation Framework (e.g., Playwright):** Running automated tests that span multiple services.
*   **Log Aggregation and Distributed Tracing Tools (e.g., Datadog):** Troubleshooting issues in a microservices environment.

## Feeling

*   üò• **Frustrated:** When the test environment is down or an issue is difficult to diagnose.
*   üò¨ **Nervous:** Worried that your changes might break something in the integrated environment.
*   üßê **Investigative:** Piecing together clues from multiple sources to find the root cause of a problem.

## Opportunities

*   Invest in making the integrated test environment more stable and reliable.
*   Implement distributed tracing to make it easier to troubleshoot issues in a microservices architecture.
*   Adopt contract testing to catch integration issues earlier in the development process.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Root Cause Analysis:** An AI system that can analyze data from multiple sources (logs, traces, metrics) to identify the likely root cause of an integration test failure.
*   **Test Data Generation:** AI tools that can generate realistic and varied test data for different scenarios.
*   **Contract Test Generation:** AI tools that can analyze API specifications and generate contract tests automatically.
