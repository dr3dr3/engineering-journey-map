# 3. Architecture and Design
‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Creating solution architectures, technical specifications, and design patterns before development begins.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we design a solution that is scalable, reliable, and maintainable?
*   How do we ensure our design aligns with broader architectural principles and standards?
*   How do we consider the non-functional requirements, such as security and performance?

## Actions

*   Writing technical design documents that outline the proposed solution.
*   Creating diagrams (e.g., sequence diagrams, architecture diagrams) to visualize the design.
*   Creating proof-of-concepts (PoCs) to validate technical approaches.

## Challenges

*   Under-engineering a solution that doesn't scale or meet future needs.
*   Failing to consider all the edge cases and potential failure modes.
*   Difficulty reaching consensus on the best technical approach.

## Interactions

*   **Principal/Staff Engineers:** Seeking guidance on complex technical challenges and ensuring architectural consistency.
*   **Engineering Team:** Collaborating on the design, debating trade-offs, and building shared understanding.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Discussing infrastructure requirements and deployment strategies.

## Touchpoints

*   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** Documenting significant design choices and their rationale.
*   **Technology Radars:** Consulting internal guidance on preferred technologies and tools.
*   **Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** Writing and sharing technical design documents.

## Feeling

*   üßê **Analytical:** Carefully considering the trade-offs of different approaches.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working with others to build a better design.
*   üí™ **Confident:** When a solid design is in place and the team is ready to build.

## Opportunities

*   Establish a lightweight, standardized process for creating and reviewing technical design documents.
*   Promote the use of Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) to document important choices.
*   Build a library of reusable design patterns and components.

## Potential for AI

*   **Design Document Analysis:** An AI system that can review a design document for completeness, clarity, and adherence to architectural principles.
*   **Technology Recommendation Engine:** AI models that can suggest appropriate libraries or frameworks based on the project's requirements and constraints.
*   **Automated Diagram Generation:** AI tools that can generate architecture or sequence diagrams from a textual description or code.
