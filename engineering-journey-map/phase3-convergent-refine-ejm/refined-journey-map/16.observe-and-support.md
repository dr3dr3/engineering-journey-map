# 16. Observe and Support
‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ

Responding to production incidents, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating resolution efforts.

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we troubleshoot and diagnose the root cause of an incident?
- How do we respond to production incidents quickly and effectively?
- How do we learn from every incident to prevent it from happening again?

## Actions
- Acknowledging an alert from Datadog and taking ownership of the incident in Jira.
- Analyzing logs, metrics, and traces within Datadog to identify the root cause of the issue.
- Conducting a "blameless post-mortem" after the incident is resolved to identify root causes and define follow-up actions.

## Challenges
- The root cause of the issue is not immediately obvious, making triaging difficult. (3)
- It's difficult to get the right people involved in the incident response across different squads. (2)
- The same incidents keep happening over and over again, indicating a need for better problem management.

## Interactions
- **On-call Engineer:** The first responder to a production incident, often from the reactive work-focused squad.
- **Incident Commander:** The person responsible for coordinating the overall incident response, potentially from the Platform team.
- **IT Operations Team:** Helps with initial triage and has deep knowledge of the production environment's manual setup.

## Touchpoints
- **Alerting Channel (Microsoft Teams):** Where the on-call engineer is notified of an incident from Datadog alerts.
- **Monitoring and Observability Platform (Datadog):** The primary source of data for troubleshooting.
- **Incident Response "War Room" (Microsoft Teams):** The central hub for coordinating the response and sharing information.

## Feeling
- üò• **Stressed:** The pressure is on to fix the problem as quickly as possible with high business impact.
- ü§î **Focused:** Deep in concentration, trying to solve a complex puzzle with limited information.
- ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working closely with a team of people across squads to resolve the incident.

## Opportunities
- Establish a clear, well-defined incident response process that is regularly practiced and documented in Confluence. (2)
- Promote a "blameless" culture where the focus is on learning and continuous improvement, not blaming individuals. (1)
- Invest in building high-quality runbooks in Confluence that are easy to follow and linked from alerts.

## Potential for AI
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** An AI system that can analyze Datadog metrics, logs, and traces to identify the most likely root cause. (3)
- **AI-Powered Incident Triage:** An AI assistant in Microsoft Teams that can automatically categorize and prioritize incidents and suggest the right runbook from Confluence.
- **Automated Post-mortem Generation:** An AI tool that can automatically generate a draft post-mortem report by summarizing the incident timeline, key events, and data.
