# 9. QA User Acceptance
â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Validating software meets business requirements and user expectations with stakeholder involvement.

## Journey Step Focus
* How do we ensure that the software we've built actually solves the user's problem?
* How do we get feedback from real users or their proxies before we release?
* How do we manage the UAT process and coordinate with stakeholders?

## Actions
* Preparing a dedicated UAT environment with the latest version of the software.
* Creating a UAT plan that outlines the goals, scope, participants, and schedule.
* Collecting and triaging feedback and bug reports from UAT.

## Challenges
* Difficulty in reproducing issues reported by UAT participants. (3)
* UAT participants who are not engaged or do not have enough time to test thoroughly. (2)
* The UAT environment is not a true reflection of the production environment. (1)

## Interactions
* **Product Manager:** The key stakeholder who often "owns" the UAT process and makes the final call on whether the software is acceptable.
* **Business Stakeholders/End Users:** The people who participate in UAT and provide feedback from a user's perspective.
* **Quality Engineer:** Often responsible for organizing and managing the UAT process.

## Touchpoints
* **UAT Environment:** A dedicated, stable environment for user acceptance testing.
* **Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear):** Logging and tracking issues found during UAT.
* **Feedback Form/Tool:** A structured way to collect feedback and bug reports from UAT participants.

## Feeling
* ðŸ˜¬ **Anxious:** Waiting for feedback from users, hoping they will like the new feature.
* ðŸ˜¥ **Disappointed:** When users are confused by the new functionality or find significant issues.
* ðŸ˜Œ **Validated:** When users are happy with the new feature and it meets their needs.

## Opportunities
* Automate the setup and data seeding of the UAT environment to make it more efficient. (3)
* Involve users and stakeholders earlier in the development process to get feedback sooner.
* Use a "beta testing" program with a select group of real customers to get more realistic feedback.

## Potential for AI
* **Bug Report Enrichment:** An AI assistant that can automatically add more context to bug reports from UAT, such as logs, screenshots, or environment details. (3)
* **Automated UAT Script Generation:** AI tools that can generate UAT scenarios and scripts based on user stories and business requirements. (1)
* **AI-Powered Feedback Analysis:** An AI system that can analyze qualitative feedback from UAT and identify common themes, sentiment, and actionable insights.
