# 15. Monitor
â˜…â˜…â˜†â˜†â˜†

Tracking system health metrics, alerts, and SLAs to maintain production service reliability.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we know if our systems are healthy?
*   How do we get alerted when something is wrong?
*   How do we make our monitoring data useful and actionable?

## Actions

*   Instrumenting code to emit key metrics, logs, and traces.
*   Creating dashboards to visualize the health of the system.
*   Setting up alerts to notify the on-call engineer when an SLO is at risk of being breached.

## Challenges

*   There is too much monitoring data, making it hard to find the important signals. (3)
*   Lack of context in the monitoring data, making it hard to troubleshoot issues. (2)
*   Alerts are too noisy, leading to "alert fatigue" and missed issues.

## Interactions

*   **Engineering Team:** Responsible for instrumenting their code and creating service-specific dashboards.
*   **IT Operations/NOC:** Monitoring the system 24/7 and performing initial triage of alerts.
*   **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE):** Often responsible for building and maintaining the monitoring platform.

## Touchpoints

*   **Monitoring and Alerting System (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus, Grafana):** The core platform for monitoring.
*   **Dashboards:** The primary way of visualizing monitoring data.
*   **Alerting Channel (e.g., PagerDuty, Opsgenie, Slack):** The channel through which alerts are delivered.

## Feeling

*   ðŸ˜¥ **Overwhelmed:** When there are too many alerts and too much data to look at.
*   ðŸ˜Œ **In Control:** When the monitoring system is providing clear, actionable signals.
*   ðŸ’ª **Proactive:** Using monitoring data to find and fix problems before they impact users.

## Opportunities

*   Adopt a standardized approach to observability, using a common set of tools and libraries across the organization. (3)
*   Implement a "blameless" culture where the focus is on learning from incidents, not blaming individuals. (2)
*   Use AIOps (AI for IT Operations) to help manage the complexity of the monitoring data. (2)

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** An AI system that can automatically detect anomalous patterns in the monitoring data that might indicate an issue. (3)
*   **Automated Root Cause Analysis:** An AI system that can analyze the data from an incident and suggest the most likely root cause. (2)
*   **Intelligent Alerting and Correlation:** An AI assistant that can group related alerts, suppress noise, and add context to alerts to make them more actionable.
