# 1. Onboarding
â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†â˜†

Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively.

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we provide comprehensive access to all required tools and systems efficiently?
- How do we create standardized development environments that eliminate "works on my machine" problems?
- How do we integrate new engineers into team culture and unwritten organizational knowledge?

## Actions
- Requesting and receiving access to source code repositories (BitBucket), issue trackers (Jira), and communication platforms (Microsoft Teams).
- Following documentation (Confluence) to install and configure required software (Visual Studio, VS Code) and dependencies.
- Pairing with a buddy or mentor to walk through the codebase and architecture.

## Challenges
- Incomplete or outdated documentation for setting up the development environment. (3)
- Delays in getting access to necessary tools and systems. (2)
- Information overload from a large and complex codebase.

## Interactions
- **Onboarding Buddy/Mentor:** Go-to person for questions, guidance, and pairing.
- **Platform/DevOps Team:** Help with environment setup and deployment pipelines.
- **Engineering Team:** Introductions, help with setup, code reviews.

## Touchpoints
- **Identity and Access Management (Azure Entra, AWS IAM):** Gaining access to various services.
- **Source Code Repository (BitBucket):** Accessing and contributing to the codebase.
- **Documentation Hub (Confluence):** Finding information about processes and architecture.

## Feeling
- ðŸ˜ƒ **Excited:** Eager to learn and start contributing to a new team and product. (3)
- ðŸ¤” **Overwhelmed:** Faced with a large amount of new information, tools, and processes. (2)
- ðŸŽ‰ **Accomplished:** After successfully setting up the environment and merging the first pull request. (1)

## Opportunities
- Automate the process of granting access to standard tools and systems. (2)
- Develop a "one-click" script to set up the local development environment. (1)
- Celebrate the first merged pull request to create a positive early win. (1)

## Potential for AI
- **Automated Codebase Summarization:** AI tools that can analyze a repository and generate a high-level overview of the architecture, key components, and dependencies. (3)
- **Code Review Assistant:** AI tools that provide automated feedback on initial pull requests to help new hires align with coding standards before a human review. (1)
- **AI-Powered Onboarding Assistant:** A chatbot that can answer common onboarding questions, point to relevant documentation, and guide new hires through setup tasks.
