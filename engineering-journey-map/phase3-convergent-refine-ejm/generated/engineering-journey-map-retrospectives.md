# Engineering Journey Map Retrospectives
## Feedback Collection to Drive Platform Engineering Priorities

This document provides retrospective formats designed to gather feedback from engineering teams that will directly inform Engineering Journey Map improvements and platform engineering priorities.

## Overview

These retrospectives are structured to:
- **Identify pain points** and friction across the engineering journey
- **Discover automation opportunities** for platform engineering
- **Prioritize platform features** based on real developer needs
- **Measure platform effectiveness** and developer satisfaction
- **Capture specific examples** to drive targeted improvements

## Retrospective Formats

### 1. Journey-Wide Health Check Retrospective
*Frequency: Quarterly | Duration: 90 minutes | Participants: Full engineering team*

#### Format: The Engineering Journey Temperature Check

**Setup**: Create a visual journey map on the wall with all 12 steps. Use colored sticky notes:
- ðŸŸ¢ Green: Works well, no friction
- ðŸŸ¡ Yellow: Some friction, manageable
- ðŸ”´ Red: Major pain point, blocks productivity
- ðŸ”µ Blue: Opportunity for platform automation

**Process**:
1. **Individual Reflection (15 mins)**: Each team member places colored stickies on each journey step
2. **Pattern Identification (20 mins)**: Group discusses clustering of colors
3. **Deep Dive on Red Areas (30 mins)**: Focus on biggest pain points
4. **Platform Opportunity Mapping (20 mins)**: Identify where platform engineering can help
5. **Action Planning (5 mins)**: Prioritize top 3 issues to address

**Key Questions**:
- Which journey steps consistently show red/yellow across team members?
- Where do we lose the most time to manual processes or waiting?
- What would make the biggest difference if the platform team automated it?
- Which pain points affect multiple teams (not just ours)?

**Output**: Heat map of journey friction + prioritized platform engineering requests

1. **Before Platform (15 mins)**: Document how tasks were done before platform tools
2. **After Platform (15 mins)**: Capture current experience with platform
3. **Wish List (20 mins)**: Brainstorm platform improvements or new capabilities
4. **Impact Scoring (10 mins)**: Rate each wish item on effort vs. impact

**Key Questions**:
- What used to take hours that now takes minutes?
- What still takes too long despite platform tools?
- If you could wave a magic wand, what would the platform do for you?

**Setup**: Focus on one specific journey step per session

**Process**:
1. **Time Tracking (10 mins)**: Share actual time spent on the journey step last sprint
2. **5 Whys Analysis (15 mins)**: For each time sink, ask "why" five times to find root cause
3. **Platform Solution Brainstorm (5 mins)**: Generate ideas for platform team

**Example Flow**:
- "CI/CD setup took 4 hours" â†’ Why? â†’ "Had to configure 5 different tools" â†’ Why? â†’ "No unified config template"...

**Key Questions**:
- How much time did this step actually take last sprint?
- What caused the delays/friction?
- What information was missing or hard to find?
- What would ideal automation look like for this step?

**Output**: Specific, actionable items for platform team with time-savings potential

### 4. Developer Experience (DevEx) Story Mapping
*Frequency: Quarterly | Duration: 2 hours | Participants: Cross-team representatives*

#### Format: User Story Mapping for Platform Services

**Setup**: Large wall/virtual board with journey steps as columns

**Process**:
1. **Current State Stories (30 mins)**: "As an engineer, I currently..." for each journey step
2. **Pain Point Stories (30 mins)**: "As an engineer, I struggle with..." 
3. **Ideal State Stories (30 mins)**: "As an engineer, I wish I could..."
4. **Platform Epic Creation (30 mins)**: Group ideal state stories into platform epics

**Key Questions**:
- What does a typical engineer's day look like across these journey steps?
- Where do engineers get stuck or frustrated?
- What would transform their experience?
- Which improvements would benefit multiple teams?

**Output**: Platform team backlog organized by user value and journey step impact

### 5. Platform ROI Retrospective
*Frequency: Monthly | Duration: 45 minutes | Participants: Tech leads + Platform team*

#### Format: Time & Cost Analysis

**Setup**: Spreadsheet with journey steps, time investment, and cost impact

**Process**:
1. **Time Audit (15 mins)**: Estimate hours spent per journey step per engineer per month
2. **Cost Calculation (10 mins)**: Convert time to dollar cost (engineer hourly rate)
3. **Platform Impact Assessment (15 mins)**: Identify where platform could reduce time/cost
4. **ROI Prioritization (5 mins)**: Rank opportunities by potential savings

**Key Questions**:
- Which journey steps consume the most engineering hours?
- What's the monthly cost of friction in each step?
- Where would platform investment pay back fastest?
- What platform features would save the most money?

**Output**: Business case for platform investments with quantified ROI

### 6. New Engineer Onboarding Retrospective
*Frequency: After each new hire's first month | Duration: 30 minutes | Participants: New hire + Mentor + Platform team*

#### Format: Journey Step Feedback Loop

**Setup**: Walk through each journey step with the new hire

**Process**:
1. **Step-by-Step Walkthrough (20 mins)**: New hire shares experience of each journey step
2. **Surprise & Confusion Moments (5 mins)**: Capture unexpected friction
3. **Platform Improvement Ideas (5 mins)**: Brainstorm solutions

**Key Questions**:
- Which steps took longer than expected?

## Feedback Collection Templates

### Pre-Retrospective Survey
Send this survey 2 days before retrospectives to prepare participants:

1. **Time Tracking**: "Log time spent on each journey step this week"
2. **Friction Points**: "List your top 3 frustrations with platform/tools"
3. **Automation Ideas**: "What manual tasks would you love to see automated?"
4. **Platform Wishlist**: "If you could add one platform feature, what would it be?"

### Post-Retrospective Action Tracker
Capture outcomes from each retrospective:

- **Pain Points Identified**: Specific friction points discovered
- **Platform Opportunities**: Automation/tooling opportunities for platform team  
- **Priority Level**: High/Medium/Low based on impact and effort
- **Owner**: Who will follow up on each action item
- **Timeline**: Expected completion date
- **Success Metrics**: How we'll measure improvement

## Implementation Recommendations

### Getting Started
1. **Start Small**: Begin with monthly Platform Value Retrospectives
2. **Focus on Data**: Collect time/cost metrics to build business case
3. **Include Platform Team**: Ensure platform engineers participate in retrospectives
4. **Close Feedback Loops**: Share back to teams what platform improvements their feedback drove

### Making It Sustainable
1. **Rotate Facilitation**: Don't always use the same facilitator
2. **Vary Formats**: Mix retrospective formats to keep them fresh
3. **Track Platform Impact**: Measure how platform improvements affect journey step satisfaction
4. **Celebrate Wins**: Share success stories when platform improvements reduce friction

### Success Metrics
- **Participation Rate**: % of engineers participating in retrospectives
- **Action Item Completion**: % of identified pain points addressed by platform team
- **Journey Step Satisfaction**: Trending satisfaction scores for each journey step
- **Platform Feature Adoption**: Usage of new platform features driven by retrospective feedback
- **Time to Value**: Reduction in time spent on friction-heavy journey steps

## Conclusion

These retrospective formats are designed to create a feedback loop between engineering teams and platform engineering, ensuring that platform investments are driven by real developer needs and pain points. Regular execution of these retrospectives will help platform teams:

- Build features that actually solve developer problems
- Prioritize work based on broad engineering team impact
- Measure the effectiveness of platform improvements
- Maintain strong relationships between platform and application teams

The key is consistency - make retrospectives a regular practice and use the insights to continuously improve the engineering journey experience.
