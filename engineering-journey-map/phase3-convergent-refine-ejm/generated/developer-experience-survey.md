## Survey Analysis Guide for Platform Teams

### Priority Matrix Analysis
Use frequency × impact scores to identify high-priority issues:
- **High Frequency + High Impact** = Immediate action required
- **Low Frequency + High Impact** = Strategic improvements
- **High Frequency + Low Impact** = Quality of life improvements
- **Low Frequency + Low Impact** = Lower priority

### Key Metrics to Track
- **Satisfaction trends** across journey steps
- **Pain point frequency** changes over time
- **Priority alignment** between teams and platform strategy
- **Net Promoter Score** progression

### Action Planning
1. **Quick Wins**: High-impact, low-effort improvements
2. **Strategic Investments**: High-impact improvements requiring significant effort
3. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular friction reduction initiatives
4. **Innovation Opportunities**: Areas for breakthrough improvements

This comprehensive survey provides platform teams with actionable insights to prioritize investments, reduce friction, and continuously improve the developer experience across the entire engineering journey.
