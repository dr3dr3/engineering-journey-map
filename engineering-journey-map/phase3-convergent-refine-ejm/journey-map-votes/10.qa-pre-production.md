# 10. QA Pre-Production

Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we ensure that the software will work correctly in the production environment?
*   How do we perform a final check for any critical issues before release?
*   How do we test the deployment process itself?
*   How do we validate the configuration of the production environment?
*   How do we conduct performance and load testing?
*   How do we make a final go/no-go decision on the release?

## Actions

*   Deploying the release candidate to a staging or pre-production environment that is an exact replica of production.
*   Running a full suite of regression tests to ensure no existing functionality has been broken.
*   Performing "smoke tests" to verify the basic functionality of the application.
*   Conducting performance, load, and stress tests to ensure the application can handle the expected traffic.
*   Verifying that all configuration settings, environment variables, and feature flags are correct.
*   Testing the rollback plan to ensure it's possible to revert to the previous version if something goes wrong.
*   Performing a final security scan of the release candidate.
*   Holding a final go/no-go meeting with all stakeholders to approve the release.

## Challenges

*   The pre-production environment is not a true mirror of production, leading to missed issues. (3)
*   Insufficient time for thorough testing before the release deadline.
*   Difficulty in generating realistic load for performance testing.
*   Last-minute changes that invalidate previous testing.
*   Lack of a clear and well-rehearsed rollback plan.
*   Pressure from the business to release despite known issues or risks.

## Interactions

*   **Release Manager:** Coordinating the final stages of the release process.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Managing the pre-production environment and the deployment process.
*   **Quality Engineer:** Leading the final testing efforts and providing a quality assessment.
*   **Engineering Team:** On standby to fix any critical issues that are found.
*   **Security Team:** Performing final security checks and giving their approval.
*   **Product Manager:** Involved in the final go/no-go decision.

## Touchpoints

*   **Pre-production/Staging Environment:** A production-like environment for final testing.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions):** Deploying the release candidate to the pre-production environment.
*   **Performance Testing Tool (e.g., JMeter, Gatling):** Simulating user load on the application.
*   **Security Scanning Tool (e.g., Snyk, Veracode):** Checking for vulnerabilities.
*   **Configuration Management System (e.g., Ansible, Terraform):** Verifying the environment configuration.
*   **Release Checklist:** A document that tracks all the final steps and approvals before a release.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting System (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus):** Verifying that the application is emitting the correct metrics in the pre-production environment.

## Feeling

*   üò¨ **Tense:** The final gate before a release, with high stakes.
*   üßê **Thorough:** Double-checking everything to ensure a smooth release. (3)
*   üí™ **Confident:** When all tests have passed and the team is ready for the release.
*   üò• **Stressed:** When a critical issue is found at the last minute.
*   ü§ù **Aligned:** When all stakeholders are in agreement on the go/no-go decision.

## Opportunities

*   Use infrastructure-as-code to ensure that the pre-production environment is an exact replica of production. (3)
*   Automate as much of the pre-production testing as possible to make it fast and repeatable. (1)
*   Develop a "canary release" or "blue-green deployment" strategy to reduce the risk of production deployments. (2)
*   Regularly practice the rollback plan to ensure it works as expected.
*   Create a clear, data-driven set of criteria for making the go/no-go decision.
*   Conduct a "pre-mortem" to identify potential risks and create mitigation plans before the release.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection:** An AI system that can monitor the pre-production environment and automatically flag any unusual behavior or performance degradation.
*   **Intelligent Release Risk Assessment:** An AI model that can analyze a release candidate and predict the likelihood of it causing a production issue, based on factors like the complexity of the changes, the results of testing, and historical data.
*   **Automated Performance Test Analysis:** AI tools that can analyze the results of performance tests and automatically identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
*   **Configuration Drift Detection:** An AI system that can compare the configuration of the pre-production and production environments and flag any discrepancies. (3)
*   **Go/No-Go Decision Support:** An AI-powered dashboard that can provide a consolidated view of all the relevant data (test results, performance metrics, risk assessment) to help stakeholders make a more informed go/no-go decision.
