# 5. Local Development

Individual coding work, writing tests, debugging, and implementing features in isolation.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we write clean, efficient, and maintainable code?
*   How do we ensure our code is well-tested?
*   How do we effectively debug and troubleshoot issues?
*   How do we stay up-to-date with the latest changes in the codebase?
*   How do we manage our local development environment?
*   How do we get fast feedback on our changes?

## Actions

*   Writing code to implement new features or fix bugs.
*   Writing unit tests and integration tests to verify the correctness of the code.
*   Using a debugger to step through code and inspect its state.
*   Running tests locally to get immediate feedback on changes.
*   Pulling the latest changes from the main branch to avoid merge conflicts.
*   Using linters and formatters to ensure code quality and consistency.
*   Creating and managing feature branches for new work.
*   Documenting code where necessary.

## Challenges

*   A slow or cumbersome local development environment. (2)
*   Flaky tests that fail intermittently. (2)
*   Difficulty reproducing bugs that occur in other environments.
*   Large, complex merge conflicts that are difficult to resolve.
*   Lack of clear coding standards or best practices.
*   Distractions and interruptions that break focus.

## Interactions

*   **Engineering Team:** Asking for help with a difficult problem, or discussing a technical approach.
*   **Onboarding Buddy/Mentor:** Getting guidance and feedback on code.
*   **Quality Engineer:** Clarifying testing requirements and acceptance criteria.
*   **Code Reviewers:** Receiving feedback on pull requests.

## Touchpoints

*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE) (e.g., VS Code, IntelliJ):** Writing, debugging, and testing code.
*   **Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):** Pushing and pulling changes, creating branches.
*   **Terminal/Command Line:** Running scripts, managing dependencies, and interacting with Git.
*   **Local Test Runner:** Executing tests and viewing the results.
*   **Debugger:** Inspecting code and variables at runtime.
*   **Local Application Stack (e.g., Docker Compose):** Running the application and its dependencies locally.
*   **Code Quality Tools (e.g., ESLint, Prettier):** Automatically checking and formatting code.

## Feeling

*   ðŸ¤” **Focused:** Deep in concentration while solving a complex problem.
*   ðŸ’¡ **Creative:** Finding an elegant solution or a clever way to implement a feature. (2)
*   ðŸ˜¥ **Frustrated:** When stuck on a bug or a difficult problem.
*   ðŸ˜Œ **Satisfied:** After writing a clean piece of code or fixing a tricky bug.
*   ðŸ˜¬ **Anxious:** When dealing with a large and complex merge conflict.

## Opportunities

*   Invest in optimizing the local development environment for speed and ease of use. (3)
*   Develop a culture of writing high-quality, reliable tests. (1)
*   Provide training on effective debugging techniques and tools.
*   Encourage the use of feature flags to decouple deployment from release. (2)
*   Establish and enforce clear coding standards and best practices.
*   Promote techniques like timeboxing and the Pomodoro Technique to manage focus and avoid distractions.
*   Use tools that provide real-time feedback on code quality and test coverage within the IDE. (3)

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Code Completion:** Intelligent code completion tools (like GitHub Copilot) that suggest lines or blocks of code as you type. (3)
*   **Automated Test Generation:** AI tools that can automatically generate unit tests for a given piece of code. (2)
*   **Intelligent Debugging:** An AI assistant that can analyze a bug report and suggest potential causes or areas of the code to investigate.
*   **Code Refactoring Suggestions:** AI tools that can identify opportunities to refactor code for improved readability, performance, or maintainability.
*   **Real-time Code Quality Feedback:** An AI-powered linter that can provide more sophisticated feedback on code quality, style, and potential bugs in real-time. (1)
