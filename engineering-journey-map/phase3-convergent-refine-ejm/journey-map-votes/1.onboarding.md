# 1. Onboarding

Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we get access to all the systems and tools we need?
*   How do we set up our local development environment?
*   How do we understand the team's codebase and coding standards?
*   How do we learn about the team's processes and ways of working?
*   How do we get to know our teammates and stakeholders?
*   How do we make our first contribution?

## Actions

*   Requesting and receiving access to source code repositories, issue trackers, and communication platforms.
*   Following documentation to install and configure required software and dependencies.
*   Cloning repositories and running the application locally.
*   Pairing with a buddy or mentor to walk through the codebase and architecture.
*   Reading team documentation on coding standards, pull request processes, and testing practices.
*   Attending team meetings and introductions.
*   Picking up a small, well-defined "good first issue".
*   Submitting a first pull request and going through the code review process.

## Challenges

*   Incomplete or outdated documentation for setting up the development environment. (3)
*   Delays in getting access to necessary tools and systems. (2)
*   Information overload from a large and complex codebase.
*   Lack of a clear "first issue" or onboarding task.
*   Difficulty finding the right person to ask for help.
*   Feeling isolated or disconnected from the team.

## Interactions

*   **Hiring Manager:** Initial point of contact, provides role context and team introduction.
*   **Onboarding Buddy/Mentor:** Go-to person for questions, guidance, and pairing.
*   **Engineering Team:** Introductions, help with setup, code reviews.
*   **IT/Support:** Provisioning hardware and access to core systems.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Help with environment setup and deployment pipelines.
*   **Product Manager:** Understanding the product vision and roadmap.

## Touchpoints

*   **Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):** Accessing and contributing to the codebase.
*   **Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear):** Finding tasks and tracking work.
*   **Communication Tool (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** Team communication and asking questions.
*   **Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** Finding information about processes and architecture.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions):** Understanding the build and deployment process.
*   **Local Development Environment (IDE, Docker):** Writing and testing code.
*   **Identity and Access Management (e.g., Okta):** Gaining access to various services.

## Feeling

*   üòÉ **Excited:** Eager to learn and start contributing to a new team and product. (3)
*   ü§î **Overwhelmed:** Faced with a large amount of new information, tools, and processes. (2)
*   üòï **Confused:** Unsure where to start or who to ask for help when encountering issues.
*   üôè **Supported:** When there is a clear onboarding plan and a helpful buddy.
*   üéâ **Accomplished:** After successfully setting up the environment and merging the first pull request. (1)

## Opportunities

*   Create a comprehensive, up-to-date onboarding guide that is regularly maintained.
*   Automate the process of granting access to standard tools and systems. (2)
*   Develop a "one-click" script to set up the local development environment. (1)
*   Curate a list of "good first issues" specifically for new hires.
*   Implement a structured onboarding buddy program with clear expectations.
*   Schedule introductory meetings with key team members and stakeholders.
*   Create a "Who's Who" guide for the team and broader organization.
*   Celebrate the first merged pull request to create a positive early win. (1)

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Onboarding Assistant:** A chatbot that can answer common onboarding questions, point to relevant documentation, and guide new hires through setup tasks.
*   **Automated Codebase Summarization:** AI tools that can analyze a repository and generate a high-level overview of the architecture, key components, and dependencies. (3)
*   **Intelligent Task Recommendation:** An AI system that suggests suitable "first issues" based on the new hire's skills and the team's needs.
*   **Personalized Learning Paths:** AI-driven recommendations for documentation, training materials, and internal presentations based on the new hire's role and background.
*   **Code Review Assistant:** AI tools that provide automated feedback on initial pull requests to help new hires align with coding standards before a human review. (1)
