# 12. Deploy Production

Executing production deployments safely with minimal downtime and comprehensive validation.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we deploy our changes to production reliably and consistently?
*   How do we minimize the risk of a deployment causing a production issue?
*   How do we ensure that the deployment process is as fast and efficient as possible?
*   How do we validate that the deployment was successful?
*   How do we quickly and safely roll back a deployment if something goes wrong?
*   How do we keep stakeholders informed during the deployment process?

## Actions

*   Executing the deployment plan, either manually or through an automated CI/CD pipeline.
*   Monitoring the progress of the deployment and looking for any errors or warnings.
*   Performing post-deployment health checks to verify that the application is running correctly.
*   Running a suite of automated smoke tests against the production environment.
*   Communicating the status of the deployment to stakeholders in a dedicated chat channel or status page.
*   If an issue is found, executing the rollback plan to revert to the previous version.
*   Closing the change request ticket and marking the deployment as successful.
*   Handing over the new release to the support team.

## Challenges

*   The deployment process is manual, error-prone, and slow.
*   A deployment fails partway through, leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
*   A "silent failure" occurs, where the deployment appears to be successful, but the application is not working correctly.
*   The rollback plan is not well-tested and fails when it's needed most.
*   Lack of visibility into the state of the production environment during and after the deployment. (3)
*   Human error during a manual deployment process. (2)

## Interactions

*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Often responsible for executing and monitoring the production deployment.
*   **Engineering Team:** On standby to troubleshoot any issues that arise during the deployment.
*   **IT Operations/NOC:** Monitoring the health of the system and responding to any alerts.
*   **Release Manager:** Coordinating the overall deployment process.
*   **Stakeholders:** Receiving updates on the progress of the deployment.

## Touchpoints

*   **CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Spinnaker):** The primary tool for automating deployments.
*   **Production Environment:** The live environment where the code is deployed.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting System (e.g., Datadog, Prometheus):** The key tool for validating the success of a deployment and detecting issues.
*   **Deployment Script/Tool (e.g., Ansible, Terraform, Helm):** The code that defines how the application is deployed.
*   **Communication Tool (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** For coordinating the deployment and communicating with stakeholders.
*   **Status Page:** A public-facing page that shows the status of the deployment.

## Feeling

*   ðŸ˜¬ **Focused:** Concentrating intently on the deployment process, ready to react to any issues.
*   ðŸ¤ž **Hopeful:** Hoping for a smooth and uneventful deployment.
*   ðŸ˜¥ **Stressed:** When things go wrong and the pressure is on to fix them quickly.
*   ðŸ˜Œ **Relieved:** After a successful deployment and all the health checks are green.
*   ðŸ’ª **Proud:** Of the team for successfully delivering a new release to customers.

## Opportunities

*   Automate the entire deployment process to make it faster, more reliable, and less error-prone. (3)
*   Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy to reduce the risk of production deployments. (2)
*   Build a comprehensive suite of automated health checks and smoke tests that run after every deployment. (2)
*   Regularly test the rollback plan to ensure it works.
*   Create a "deployment dashboard" that provides a real-time view of the deployment process and the health of the system. (1)
*   Adopt a "you build it, you run it" model, where the development team is responsible for deploying and supporting their own services.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Deployment Validation:** An AI system that can analyze monitoring data after a deployment and automatically determine if it was successful or if a rollback is needed. (3)
*   **Intelligent Rollback:** An AI assistant that can automatically trigger a rollback if it detects a problem, and can even suggest the safest way to roll back.
*   **Deployment Optimization:** AI models that can analyze past deployments and suggest ways to make the process faster and more reliable.
*   **Automated Communication:** An AI-powered bot that can automatically post updates to a status page or chat channel during a deployment.
*   **Root Cause Analysis of Failed Deployments:** An AI system that can analyze the logs and other data from a failed deployment to identify the root cause of the failure.
