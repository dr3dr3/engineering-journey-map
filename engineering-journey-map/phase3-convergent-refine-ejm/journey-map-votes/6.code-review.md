# 6. Code reviews

Team-based technical decision making, code reviews, knowledge sharing, and cross-team coordination.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we effectively review each other's code?
*   How do we make technical decisions as a team?
*   How do we share knowledge and learn from each other?
*   How do we coordinate work with other teams?
*   How do we maintain a healthy and constructive team culture?
*   How do we handle disagreements and conflicts?

## Actions

*   Creating and submitting pull requests for review.
*   Reviewing pull requests from other team members, providing constructive feedback.
*   Participating in pair programming or mob programming sessions.
*   Engaging in technical discussions in team meetings, on Slack, or in design documents.
*   Presenting a technical topic to the team in a brown bag session or tech talk.
*   Creating or contributing to team documentation.
*   Collaborating with other teams to define API contracts or resolve dependencies.
*   Responding to feedback on a pull request and making necessary changes.

## Challenges

*   Code reviews that are slow or superficial.
*   Feedback that is overly critical or not constructive.
*   Difficulty scheduling time for pair programming or other collaborative activities. (2)
*   Lack of psychological safety, making it difficult to ask questions or admit mistakes.
*   "Silos" of knowledge, where only one or two people understand a particular part of the system. (3)
*   Communication breakdowns between teams.

## Interactions

*   **Engineering Team:** The primary group for collaboration, code reviews, and knowledge sharing.
*   **Engineering Manager:** Facilitating team discussions and helping to resolve conflicts.
*   **Product Manager:** Providing context and clarification during technical discussions.
*   **Other Engineering Teams:** Coordinating on cross-team projects and dependencies.
*   **Principal/Staff Engineers:** Seeking guidance on complex technical decisions.

## Touchpoints

*   **Source Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab):** The central hub for code reviews via pull requests.
*   **Communication Tool (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** Real-time discussions and knowledge sharing.
*   **Video Conferencing Tool (e.g., Zoom, Google Meet):** For pair programming and remote collaboration.
*   **Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** A shared space for team documentation and decision records.
*   **Whiteboarding Tool (e.g., Miro, FigJam):** Collaborative design and brainstorming.
*   **IDE with Collaboration Features (e.g., VS Code Live Share):** Real-time code sharing and editing.

## Feeling

*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working together to achieve a common goal. (3)
*   üôè **Supported:** Feeling that the team has your back and is there to help. (2)
*   ü§ì **Curious:** Learning from the expertise and perspectives of others. (1)
*   üò¨ **Vulnerable:** Putting your code out there for others to critique.
*   üò† **Defensive:** When receiving feedback that feels unfair or personal.

## Opportunities

*   Establish clear guidelines and expectations for code reviews.
*   Promote a culture of giving and receiving feedback gracefully.
*   Dedicate regular time for pair programming or mob programming.
*   Create a "blameless" culture where mistakes are seen as learning opportunities. (2)
*   Implement a system for rotating ownership of different parts of the codebase to spread knowledge. (3)
*   Hold regular cross-team meetings to improve communication and coordination.
*   Use tools that facilitate asynchronous collaboration, such as threaded discussions in pull requests.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Code Review Assistant:** An AI tool that can automatically review a pull request for common issues, style violations, and potential bugs, providing initial feedback before a human reviewer. (3)
*   **Knowledge Sharing Bot:** An AI-powered bot that can identify and surface relevant documentation or past discussions when a question is asked in a chat channel.
*   **Meeting Assistant:** An AI tool that can transcribe meetings, identify action items, and summarize key decisions.
*   **Expert Finder:** An AI system that can identify subject matter experts on a particular topic within the organization based on their code contributions, documentation, and chat history.
*   **Sentiment Analysis:** AI tools that can analyze the language used in code reviews and other communications to identify potential conflicts or negative sentiment, allowing managers to intervene proactively.
