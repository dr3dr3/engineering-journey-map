# 11. Prepare Change

Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we formally document the change we are about to make in production?
*   How do we communicate the change to all relevant stakeholders?
*   How do we get the necessary approvals to proceed with the deployment?
*   How do we ensure that our change request meets all the requirements of the change management process?
*   How do we schedule the change to minimize disruption?
*   How do we create a detailed plan for implementing the change?

## Actions

*   Creating a formal change request ticket in a system like ServiceNow or Jira.
*   Writing a detailed description of the change, including the reason for the change, the expected impact, and the implementation plan. (3)
*   Identifying all the systems and services that will be affected by the change.
*   Creating a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan, including pre-deployment checks, deployment steps, and post-deployment validation.
*   Developing a rollback plan in case the deployment fails.
*   Submitting the change request for review and approval by the Change Advisory Board (CAB) or other governing body.
*   Communicating the change schedule to all stakeholders, including customer support, sales, and marketing.
*   Scheduling the deployment in a change management calendar.

## Challenges

*   The change management process is bureaucratic and slow. (2)
*   The requirements for a change request are unclear or overly complex.
*   Getting timely approvals from all the required stakeholders.
*   Last-minute requests for more information or changes to the plan.
*   Difficulty in accurately assessing the risk and impact of a change.
*   Resistance to the change from some stakeholders.

## Interactions

*   **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** The formal body that reviews and approves change requests.
*   **Release Manager:** Often responsible for creating and managing the change request.
*   **Engineering Team:** Providing the technical details for the change request.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Providing details about the infrastructure and deployment process.
*   **Business Stakeholders:** Who need to be aware of the change and its potential impact on customers.
*   **IT Operations:** Who may be involved in implementing or monitoring the change.

## Touchpoints

*   **Change Management System (e.g., ServiceNow, Jira):** The system of record for all change requests.
*   **Change Request Form:** The specific template or set of fields that need to be filled out for a change request.
*   **Implementation Plan Document:** A detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing the change.
*   **Rollback Plan Document:** A detailed, step-by-step guide for reverting the change if necessary.
*   **Change Calendar:** A calendar that shows the schedule for all upcoming changes.
*   **CAB Meeting:** The meeting where change requests are reviewed and approved.

## Feeling

*   üò• Feeling concerned that the process is more about checking boxes than managing risk.
*   üßê Carefully filling out all the details of the change request.
*   üò¨ Waiting for approval, hoping that the change is not rejected.
*   ü§ù Working with other teams to gather all the necessary information for the change request.
*   üí™ Feeling confident that there is a solid plan in place for the deployment.

## Opportunities

*   Streamline the change management process for low-risk, routine changes. (3)
*   Automate the creation of change requests from CI/CD pipeline data. (1)
*   Provide clear templates and examples for change requests and implementation plans.
*   Establish a "standard change" process for pre-approved, low-risk changes that do not require CAB approval. (2)
*   Use a risk assessment matrix to standardize the way that risk is evaluated.
*   Integrate the change management system with other tools (like the CI/CD pipeline and monitoring system) to provide more context and automation. (2)

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Change Request Generation:** An AI assistant that can automatically generate a draft change request based on the user stories and code changes in a release.
*   **Risk Assessment AI:** An AI model that can analyze a change request and predict its risk level based on historical data and the nature of the change.
*   **Implementation Plan Generation:** AI tools that can generate a detailed implementation and rollback plan based on the services being changed and the deployment patterns being used.
*   **Automated CAB Approval:** For low-risk changes, an AI system could automatically approve the change request if it meets all the predefined criteria. (3)
*   **Change Impact Analysis:** An AI system that can analyze the dependencies between services and predict the potential blast radius of a change.
