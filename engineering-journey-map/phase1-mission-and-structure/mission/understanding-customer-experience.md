# Why Platform PMs Must Deeply Understand the Current Developer Experience

## You Can't Fix What You Don't Understand

Platform teams often build solutions for problems they *assume* developers have, rather than the problems developers *actually* face. Without understanding the current experience, PMs risk creating elegant platforms that nobody uses because they solve the wrong problems or add more friction than they remove.

Consider a platform team that builds a sophisticated GitOps deployment system, only to discover developers were actually struggling with local development environment setup, not deployments. Months of work solving a non-problem while the real pain point persists.

## The Hidden Cost of Workarounds

Engineers are resourceful - when platforms don't meet their needs, they create workarounds. Without understanding the current experience, PMs miss these shadow workflows that reveal critical gaps. These workarounds represent:

- **Wasted time**: Engineers repeatedly solving the same problems individually
- **Security risks**: Unofficial tools and processes bypassing governance
- **Technical debt**: Quick fixes that become permanent anti-patterns
- **Lost insights**: Valuable feedback about what the platform should actually provide

A PM who understands current workflows can identify these workarounds and address root causes rather than symptoms.

## Adoption Lives or Dies on Trust

Internal engineers have a choice - they can use the platform or build their own solutions. Unlike external customers, they have the technical skills to bypass your platform entirely. Trust is earned by demonstrating you understand their reality.

When engineers see that the platform team "gets it" - understands their 3am debugging sessions, their pressure to ship features, their frustration with flaky tests - they become partners rather than skeptics. This trust translates directly into adoption rates and feedback quality.

## Context Drives Prioritization

Understanding the current experience provides crucial context for prioritization decisions:

**Frequency vs Severity**: A minor friction point encountered 50 times daily might matter more than a major issue hit once quarterly. Only by understanding daily workflows can PMs identify these high-frequency pain points.

**Cascading Impact**: Some problems create ripple effects. A slow CI pipeline doesn't just waste 10 minutes - it breaks flow state, delays feedback loops, and encourages larger, riskier commits. Understanding the full experience reveals these hidden multipliers.

**Team-Specific Needs**: Different teams have different workflows. The ML team's need for GPU resources differs vastly from the web team's need for edge caching. Without understanding these contexts, platforms become lowest-common-denominator solutions that serve nobody well.

## Measuring What Matters

Without understanding current workflows, PMs choose vanity metrics over value metrics. They might celebrate "50% faster infrastructure provisioning" while developers still wait hours for end-to-end environment setup. Understanding the complete experience ensures metrics align with actual developer productivity.

Real example: A platform team celebrated reducing deployment time from 30 to 5 minutes, but developers revealed the real bottleneck was the 2-hour wait for code review approval. The platform optimization had minimal impact on actual velocity.

## The Language Barrier

Engineers and PMs often speak different languages. Engineers discuss technical implementation; PMs think in user journeys and business value. Understanding the current experience helps PMs translate between these worlds:

- Engineer: "The service mesh is adding 100ms latency"
- PM who understands: "This latency makes local development painful, forcing engineers to deploy to staging for testing, slowing the entire feedback loop"

This translation ability is crucial for securing resources, explaining priorities to leadership, and building platform roadmaps that resonate with both engineers and executives.

## Preventing Platform Sprawl

Many organizations have graveyards of abandoned internal tools - platforms that seemed like good ideas but never gained traction. Understanding current experiences helps PMs identify:

- Which existing tools engineers actually value vs tolerate vs avoid
- Where consolidation makes sense vs where diversity is beneficial  
- What "must have" features are actually "nice to have" in practice

## Building Empathy Into Design

Platforms often optimize for the wrong user. They make life easier for the platform team (clean architecture, elegant abstractions) rather than the developers using it. Understanding current pain points builds empathy that influences every design decision:

- Error messages that actually help debugging rather than generic stack traces
- Documentation written for common tasks, not architectural theory
- APIs that follow developer mental models, not infrastructure patterns
- Defaults that match 80% use cases, not edge cases

## The Competitive Advantage

Even in internal platforms, competition exists. Developers can choose cloud vendor tools, open-source solutions, or build custom implementations. Understanding why developers currently choose (or avoid) certain tools informs platform strategy:

- What makes developers choose kubectl over your custom CLI?
- Why do teams prefer GitHub Actions over your Jenkins setup?
- What drives shadow IT purchases of external tools?

## Creating Feedback Loops That Work

Understanding current experiences helps PMs design effective feedback mechanisms. They know:
- When in the workflow to gather feedback (not during crunch time)
- Who to talk to (both power users and strugglers)
- What questions to ask (specific pain points, not general satisfaction)
- How to observe (watching actual work, not demos)

## The Bottom Line

A Platform PM who doesn't understand the current developer experience is like a chef who never tastes their own food. They might follow all the right processes, use quality ingredients, and present beautifully - but if it doesn't taste good, nobody will eat it.

The investment in understanding current experiences pays dividends in:
- Higher platform adoption rates
- Fewer abandoned initiatives
- Better developer productivity metrics
- Reduced shadow IT
- Increased developer satisfaction
- Faster identification of high-impact improvements

Platform engineering succeeds when it makes developers' lives demonstrably better. You can only make something better if you truly understand how it works today - not in theory or architecture diagrams, but in the messy, practical reality of daily engineering work.
