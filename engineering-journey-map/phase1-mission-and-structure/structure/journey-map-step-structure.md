## Success Indicators

A well-documented journey step should:

1. Enable engineers to self-serve 80% of the time
2. Reduce support tickets by clearly addressing common issues
3. Decrease time-to-completion through clear guidance
4. Improve satisfaction scores through reduced friction
5. Provide clear escalation paths when self-service isn't enough
6. Generate actionable metrics for continuous improvement
7. Build confidence through examples and best practices
8. Foster community through shared experiences and solutions

This guideline ensures each step in the Engineering Journey Map is thoroughly documented, measurable, and continuously improved based on real engineer experiences and needs.
