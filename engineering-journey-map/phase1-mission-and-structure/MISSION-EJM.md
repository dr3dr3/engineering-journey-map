# Engineering Journey Map

The purpose of a journey map is to represent a user's or customer's experience with a product or service, highlighting their interactions, emotions, and pain points at each stage. It helps in understanding the user's perspective, identify areas for improvement, and ultimately enhance the overall experience.

The journey map here is focused on Software and Quality Engineers as the customer/user. They are referred to as "Engineers" through out the documents. 

The journey map steps represent the whole experience from start to finish for Engineers, from the moment they are recruited and onboarded all the way through the typical software development lifecycle, and finally their continual growth and improvement. 

The markdown documents in this folder represent the journey map for Engineers. 

Each markdown document represents a step in the journey map and the files are numbered according the sequence of the journey map steps.

## Structure of markdown documents for the Journey Map

The common structure of these documents is as follows:

1. Journey Step Focus
    * What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?
    * List of 4 to 6 items that describes the focus
    * Each item is framed as a "How do we... " question
1. Actions
    * What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?
    * List of 5 to 8 items that describes the actions Engineers take
1. Challenges
    * What challenges are typically experiences by Engineers during this step?
    * List of 4 to 6 items that describe the challenges Engineers commonly encounter
1. Interactions
    * Who do the Engineers engage with during this step?
    * List of up to 7 items
    * Formatted with the name of the role or team they interact with, followed by a colon and then how Engineers interact with them
1. Touchpoints
    * Where do the Engineers interact with typical platform services during this step?
    * List of up to 8 items
    * Formatted with the name of the platform service at the start in bold and then description of the platform service
1. Feeling
    * What feelings do Engineers experience during this step?
    * List of up to 5 items
    * Formatted with the main feeling word first and then why they feel that way
    * Include an emoji at the start of the list item that best represents the emotion
1. Opportunities
    * What opportunities are there for improvements to the actions in this step? 
    * How does this improve the feelings for Engineers?
    * List of up to 8 items
    * Order the items with the most impactful / beneficial ones first
1. Potenital for AI
    * How can AI be potentially used to improve things for this step?
    * List of up to 5 items
    * The name of the idea is in bold, followed by a description of it

## Steps in the Engineering Journey Map

The Engineering Journey Map is comprised of the following steps in the set order. This represents the flow of the journey.

1. **Onboarding** - Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively
2. **Planning Work** - Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints
3. **Architecture and Design** - Creating solution architectures, technical specifications, and design patterns before development begins
4. **QA Pre-Development** - Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts
5. **Local Development** - Individual coding work, writing tests, debugging, and implementing features in isolation
6. **Collaboration** - Team-based technical decision making, code reviews, knowledge sharing, and cross-team coordination
7. **QA Isolated** - Testing individual features or changes in controlled environments separate from other ongoing work
8. **QA Integrated** - Testing how multiple components work together across services and systems
9. **QA User Acceptance** - Validating software meets business requirements and user expectations with stakeholder involvement
10. **QA Pre-Production** - Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions
11. **Prepare Change** - Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes
12. **Deploy Production** - Executing production deployments safely with minimal downtime and comprehensive validation
13. **Release to Customers** - Controlling feature rollouts to customers using feature flags and progressive release strategies
14. **QA Production** - Monitoring and validating production functionality after customer release to catch issues early
15. **Monitor** - Tracking system health metrics, alerts, and SLAs to maintain production service reliability
16. **Observe and Support** - Responding to production incidents, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating resolution efforts
17. **Assess and Feedback** - Collecting and analyzing customer feedback to identify improvement opportunities and measure satisfaction
18. **Manage Tech Debt** - Systematically identifying, prioritizing, and addressing technical debt alongside feature development
19. **Grow Capabilities** - Developing individual and team skills through learning programs, mentorship, and knowledge sharing
20. **Continuous Improvement** - Identifying process improvements, running experiments, and fostering a culture of ongoing enhancement
