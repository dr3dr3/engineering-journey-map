# Engineering Journey Map: Step 6 - CI/CD Integration

## 1. Step Overview

### Purpose Statement
This step establishes automated build, test, and deployment pipelines that integrate applications with the platform's continuous integration and delivery infrastructure.

- Testing suite completed and passing locally
- Build scripts and configuration defined
- Platform deployment manifests created
- Security and compliance requirements identified

### Exit Criteria
- CI/CD pipelines fully configured and operational
- Automated builds triggering on code commits
- All quality gates passing (tests, security, compliance)
- Artifacts successfully published to registries
- Deployment pipeline ready for environment promotion
- Team notifications and monitoring configured
