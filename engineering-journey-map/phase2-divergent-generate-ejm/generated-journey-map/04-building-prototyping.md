# Engineering Journey Map: Step 4 - Building & Prototyping

## 1. Step Overview

### Purpose Statement
This step encompasses the active development phase where engineers transform ideas into working code using platform services and capabilities. Engineers create initial project structures, write business logic, integrate with platform APIs, and iterate on their designs through rapid prototyping. This phase establishes the foundation of the application architecture and validates technical decisions through hands-on implementation, setting the trajectory for the entire project lifecycle.

### Entry Criteria
- Local development environment fully configured and operational
- Project requirements clearly defined and understood
- Platform services selected based on use case needs
- Access to necessary platform APIs and resources granted
- Development tools and SDKs properly installed

### Exit Criteria
- Working prototype demonstrating core functionality
- Platform services successfully integrated
- Code structure follows platform conventions
- Basic error handling implemented
- Local testing confirms expected behavior
- Code ready for comprehensive testing phase
