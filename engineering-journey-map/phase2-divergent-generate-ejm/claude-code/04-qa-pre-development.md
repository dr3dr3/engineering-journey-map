# 4. QA Pre-Development

Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we create comprehensive test strategies that cover all quality aspects early in development?
- How do we design test cases that effectively validate business requirements and edge cases?
- How do we prepare test environments that accurately reflect production conditions?
- How do we ensure test automation frameworks are ready before development begins?
- How do we coordinate testing activities across multiple teams and dependencies?
- How do we plan for performance, security, and accessibility testing requirements?

## Actions

- Analyze requirements and acceptance criteria to design comprehensive test coverage plans
- Create detailed test cases covering happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios
- Prepare test data sets that represent realistic production scenarios and edge conditions
- Set up isolated test environments with proper configurations and service dependencies
- Design automated test frameworks and select appropriate testing tools and libraries
- Plan performance testing scenarios including load, stress, and endurance testing
- Coordinate with security teams to plan penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- Create test execution schedules and coordinate testing activities with development timelines

## Challenges

- Incomplete requirements making it difficult to create comprehensive test cases early
- Complex environment dependencies that are difficult to replicate in test environments
- Limited access to production-like data for creating realistic test scenarios
- Coordinating test environment availability across multiple teams and projects
- Balancing test coverage comprehensiveness with resource constraints and timelines
- Ensuring test automation frameworks can adapt to changing application architectures
