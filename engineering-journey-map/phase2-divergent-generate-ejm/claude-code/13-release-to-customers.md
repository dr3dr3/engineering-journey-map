# 13. Release to Customers

Controlling feature rollouts to customers using feature flags and progressive release strategies.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we control feature rollouts to minimize risk while maximizing user feedback opportunities?
- How do we monitor user adoption and feedback during progressive feature releases?
- How do we quickly disable features if critical issues are discovered after customer release?
- How do we target feature releases to specific user segments for optimal validation?
- How do we communicate new features effectively to users and support teams?
- How do we measure feature success and user satisfaction during rollout periods?

## Actions

- Configure feature flags and rollout strategies to control feature visibility to customer segments
- Execute gradual rollouts starting with internal users and expanding to broader customer populations
- Monitor user adoption metrics, feature usage patterns, and customer feedback during rollouts
- Coordinate feature communication with marketing and customer success teams for user notification
- Prepare support teams with feature documentation and troubleshooting guides for customer assistance
- Execute feature killswitches immediately if critical issues impact customer experience or business operations
- Analyze feature performance metrics and user behavior to validate business objectives
- Document rollout results and customer feedback for product improvement and future release planning

## Challenges

- Balancing feature rollout speed with risk management and customer impact considerations
- Managing complex feature flag configurations across multiple applications and user segments
- Coordinating feature communication across multiple customer touchpoints and support channels
- Monitoring diverse user segments with different usage patterns and feedback mechanisms
- Responding quickly to customer issues while maintaining proper incident response procedures
- Ensuring consistent feature behavior across different user segments and rollout phases
