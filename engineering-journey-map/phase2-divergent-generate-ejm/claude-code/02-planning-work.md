# 2. Planning Work

Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we translate business requirements into clear, actionable technical specifications?
- How do we accurately estimate effort and complexity for development tasks?
- How do we prioritize work effectively while balancing technical debt with feature development?
- How do we ensure proper dependency mapping and identify potential blockers early?
- How do we create realistic sprint commitments that account for team capacity and velocity?

## Actions

- Analyze business requirements and acceptance criteria with product owners and stakeholders
- Break down large features into smaller, manageable user stories and technical tasks
- Estimate effort using story points, planning poker, or other team-agreed methodologies
- Identify technical dependencies and coordinate with other teams for integration points
- Assess technical debt impact and advocate for inclusion of refactoring work in sprint planning
- Review team velocity and capacity to create realistic sprint commitments
- Define Definition of Done criteria and ensure alignment across team members
- Plan testing approach and identify test automation requirements

## Challenges

- Incomplete or changing requirements that affect scope and estimation accuracy
- Difficulty estimating effort for new technologies or unfamiliar problem domains
- Balancing feature delivery pressure with necessary technical debt reduction work
- Managing dependencies across multiple teams with different priorities and timelines
- Accounting for unexpected complexity and unknown unknowns in estimation
- Limited visibility into team member availability and competing priorities

## Interactions

- Product Owner: Requirements clarification, priority setting, and acceptance criteria definition
- Scrum Master: Sprint planning facilitation, capacity planning, and impediment identification
- Technical Architect: Technical feasibility assessment and design approach validation
- DevOps Engineer: Infrastructure requirements planning and deployment strategy discussion
- QA Engineer: Test strategy planning and acceptance criteria validation
- Team Members: Effort estimation, task breakdown, and capacity planning collaboration
- Stakeholders: Business context clarification and priority alignment discussions

## Touchpoints

- **Team Communication Platform**: Slack or Teams for real-time discussion and clarification requests
- **Architecture Documentation**: Design documents and architectural decision records for technical context
- **Version Control System**: Git repositories for reviewing code structure and understanding implementation scope
- **Analytics Platform**: Team velocity tracking and capacity planning tools for data-driven planning decisions
- **Calendar Systems**: Team availability tracking and meeting scheduling for planning sessions

## Feeling

- ü§î Thoughtful about ensuring thorough analysis while avoiding analysis paralysis
- üìä Analytical when breaking down complex problems into manageable components
- üò∞ Pressured to provide accurate estimates despite uncertainty and changing requirements
- ü§ù Collaborative during team discussions and cross-functional planning sessions
- üéØ Focused on creating realistic commitments that balance ambition with achievability

## Opportunities

- Implement AI-powered story estimation based on historical team velocity and similar task patterns
- Create automated dependency detection tools that analyze code relationships and team ownership
- Develop better templates and guidelines for user story creation and acceptance criteria definition
- Establish cross-team coordination frameworks to improve visibility into external dependencies
- Build capacity planning tools that account for individual preferences, skills, and development goals
- Create feedback loops from completed work to improve future estimation accuracy
- Implement real-time requirement change tracking to manage scope creep effectively
- Develop automated technical debt identification and prioritization frameworks

## Potential for AI

- **Intelligent Story Estimation**: AI analyzing historical data patterns to suggest effort estimates based on story complexity and team velocity
- **Dependency Discovery**: AI examining code repositories and team structures to automatically identify potential blockers and coordination needs
- **Capacity Optimization**: AI considering individual skills, preferences, and career goals to optimize task assignment and team capacity utilization
- **Requirements Analysis**: AI helping identify gaps or ambiguities in requirements by comparing against successful project patterns
- **Sprint Success Prediction**: AI models predicting sprint completion likelihood based on historical team performance and current capacity factors
