# 11. Prepare Change

Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we create comprehensive change requests that clearly communicate deployment scope and risk?
- How do we coordinate change approvals across different governance bodies and stakeholder groups?
- How do we schedule production changes to minimize business impact and maximize success probability?
- How do we ensure proper documentation and communication of change procedures and rollback plans?
- How do we manage dependencies between multiple changes and coordinate cross-team deployments?
- How do we balance governance requirements with business agility and time-to-market needs?

## Actions

- Create detailed change requests including technical specifications, business impact, and risk assessment
- Develop comprehensive deployment plans with step-by-step procedures and timeline estimates
- Prepare rollback plans and procedures for quick recovery in case of deployment issues
- Coordinate change approval workflows across Change Advisory Board and business stakeholders
- Schedule maintenance windows and communicate planned downtime to affected users and systems
- Prepare communication plans for notifying stakeholders of changes and potential business impact
- Validate change procedures through dry-runs and rehearsal activities in pre-production environments
- Coordinate dependencies with other teams and ensure proper sequencing of related changes

## Challenges

- Balancing comprehensive change documentation with development velocity and release timing requirements
- Coordinating complex approval processes across multiple governance bodies with different priorities and timelines
- Managing change scheduling conflicts and finding optimal maintenance windows with minimal business impact
- Ensuring accurate risk assessment when dealing with complex systems and unpredictable dependencies
- Communicating technical changes effectively to non-technical stakeholders and governance bodies
- Managing emergency changes that require expedited approval processes while maintaining proper controls

## Interactions

- Change Manager: Leading change request preparation and coordinating approval processes across stakeholder groups
- Change Advisory Board: Presenting change requests and obtaining formal approval for production deployments
- Business Stakeholders: Communicating business impact and obtaining approval for changes affecting business operations
- Technical Architecture Board: Validating technical approach and ensuring compliance with architectural standards
- Security Officer: Ensuring changes comply with security policies and don't introduce security vulnerabilities
- Compliance Officer: Validating changes meet regulatory requirements and audit trail documentation standards
- Operations Team: Coordinating deployment scheduling and ensuring operational readiness for change execution

## Touchpoints

- **Change Management System**: ServiceNow, Remedy, or similar platforms for creating and tracking change requests through approval workflows
- **Documentation Platform**: Confluence, SharePoint for storing detailed change documentation and procedures
- **Approval Workflow Platform**: Systems for routing change requests through governance bodies and collecting approvals
- **Communication Tools**: Email, Slack, or Teams for coordinating change communication and stakeholder notification
- **Calendar Systems**: Scheduling tools for coordinating maintenance windows and change deployment timing
- **Risk Assessment Tools**: Platforms for conducting and documenting risk analysis and mitigation planning
- **Deployment Automation**: CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code tools for standardizing deployment procedures
- **Audit Tracking Systems**: Tools for maintaining compliance audit trails and change history documentation

## Feeling

- üìã Methodical when preparing comprehensive change documentation and following established governance processes
- üò∞ Concerned about navigating complex approval processes while meeting business timeline requirements
- üéØ Focused on ensuring all stakeholders understand change impact and approve deployment plans
- ü§ù Diplomatic when managing different stakeholder priorities and negotiating change approval requirements
- üò§ Frustrated by bureaucratic processes that seem to slow down necessary business changes and improvements

## Opportunities

- Implement automated change request generation based on code changes and deployment automation
- Create intelligent risk assessment tools that analyze change complexity and suggest appropriate approval workflows
- Develop automated change scheduling optimization that finds optimal maintenance windows with minimal business impact
- Build stakeholder communication automation that keeps all parties informed of change status and progress
- Establish change impact analysis tools that automatically identify affected systems and dependencies
- Create streamlined approval workflows for low-risk changes while maintaining proper controls
- Implement change success tracking and analysis to improve future change planning and risk assessment
- Develop change template libraries that standardize documentation for common types of deployments

## Potential for AI

- **Intelligent Change Risk Assessment**: AI analyzing change characteristics and historical data to predict deployment risk and suggest appropriate approval processes
- **Automated Impact Analysis**: AI identifying all systems and stakeholders affected by proposed changes based on system dependencies and business processes
- **Smart Scheduling Optimization**: AI finding optimal deployment windows by analyzing business calendars, system usage patterns, and stakeholder availability
- **Change Documentation Generation**: AI automatically generating change request documentation based on code changes and deployment procedures
- **Predictive Change Success Analysis**: AI predicting change success likelihood based on complexity, team experience, and historical deployment patterns
