# 15. Monitor

Tracking system health metrics, alerts, and SLAs to maintain production service reliability.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we maintain comprehensive visibility into system health across all production components?
- How do we ensure monitoring alerts are actionable and don't create unnecessary noise for operations teams?
- How do we track and report on service level objectives and customer experience metrics?
- How do we detect performance degradation and capacity issues before they impact customers?
- How do we coordinate monitoring activities across multiple teams and system domains?
- How do we balance monitoring comprehensiveness with system performance impact and cost?

## Actions

- Configure comprehensive monitoring dashboards showing system health, performance, and business metrics
- Set up intelligent alerting rules that notify teams of issues without creating alert fatigue
- Monitor service level indicators and track compliance with service level objectives and agreements
- Analyze performance trends and capacity utilization to predict and prevent resource bottlenecks
- Coordinate monitoring activities across different teams and ensure proper coverage of all system components
- Maintain monitoring infrastructure and ensure high availability of monitoring systems themselves
- Generate regular monitoring reports for stakeholders showing system reliability and performance trends
- Tune monitoring sensitivity and alert thresholds based on operational experience and false positive analysis

## Challenges

- Managing monitoring complexity across distributed systems with multiple technology stacks and dependencies
- Balancing comprehensive monitoring coverage with alert noise and operations team cognitive load
- Ensuring monitoring systems themselves remain reliable and don't become single points of failure
- Correlating monitoring data across different systems to provide coherent incident detection and analysis
- Maintaining monitoring system performance while collecting detailed metrics from high-volume production systems
- Adapting monitoring configurations as systems evolve and new components are added to production
