# 1. Onboarding

Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we provide comprehensive access to all required tools and systems efficiently?
- How do we structure information delivery to prevent overwhelming new team members?
- How do we ensure documentation remains current and accurately reflects system versions?
- How do we integrate new engineers into team culture and unwritten organizational knowledge?
- How do we create standardized development environments that eliminate "works on my machine" problems?

## Actions

- Complete security training and obtain necessary access credentials
- Set up development environment using containerized templates and Infrastructure as Code
- Review team documentation, coding standards, and architectural guidelines
- Attend team meetings and shadow experienced team members during their daily work
- Complete assigned starter tasks with mentor guidance and feedback
- Configure local development tools, IDE settings, and productivity extensions
- Participate in team retrospectives and contribute observations from fresh perspective
- Complete compliance training and understand organizational policies and procedures

## Challenges

- Access delays due to complex approval processes and multiple system dependencies
- Information overload from trying to absorb too much technical and cultural knowledge simultaneously
- Outdated documentation that doesn't match current system configurations or processes
- Difficulty understanding implicit team dynamics and unwritten rules of engagement
- Complex local development setup with environment-specific configurations and dependencies
- Feeling isolated or hesitant to ask questions in new team environment

## Interactions

- Onboarding Buddy: Daily check-ins for questions, guidance, and emotional support during transition period
- Team Lead: Weekly one-on-ones to discuss progress, concerns, and adjustment to team expectations
- DevOps/Platform Team: Technical support for environment setup and access provisioning
- Security Team: Compliance training delivery and access approval processes
- HR Representative: Administrative onboarding, benefits enrollment, and policy orientation
- Peer Developers: Informal mentoring, code review participation, and knowledge sharing sessions
- Product Owner: Context on current projects, business objectives, and customer requirements

## Touchpoints

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Single sign-on systems providing secure access to development tools and production monitoring dashboards
- **Version Control System**: Git repositories with branch protection rules and automated code quality checks
- **Development Environment Platform**: Containerized development environments with pre-configured toolchains and dependencies
- **Documentation Platform**: Knowledge bases containing team processes, architectural decisions, and troubleshooting guides
- **Communication Tools**: Slack or Teams channels for team coordination and instant messaging
- **Project Management System**: Jira or Azure DevOps for tracking tasks, viewing project status, and understanding team workflows
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Jenkins or GitHub Actions providing visibility into build processes and deployment procedures
- **Learning Management System**: Internal training platforms with role-specific learning paths and certification tracking

## Feeling

- ðŸ˜° Overwhelmed by the volume of new information and systems to learn within compressed timeframes
- ðŸ¤” Confused about team processes and cultural norms that aren't explicitly documented
- ðŸ˜Ÿ Anxious about making mistakes or asking too many questions in new environment
- ðŸŽ¯ Motivated to contribute meaningfully and prove value to the team quickly
- ðŸ‘¥ Grateful for supportive team members who invest time in knowledge transfer and mentoring

## Opportunities

- Implement interactive onboarding checklists with progress tracking and automated verification of completion
- Create automated testing of documentation accuracy to ensure guides match current system versions
- Develop video tutorials for complex setup processes to supplement written documentation
- Establish protected focus time for deep learning without meeting interruptions or urgent requests
- Design peer mentorship programs pairing new engineers with recent hires who remember onboarding challenges
- Build self-service portals for common access requests to reduce dependency on manual approval processes
- Implement standardized development environments using containers to eliminate configuration drift
- Create feedback loops to continuously improve onboarding based on new hire experiences

## Potential for AI

- **Automated Environment Setup**: AI-powered scripts that analyze role requirements and automatically configure development environments with appropriate tools and access permissions
- **Intelligent Onboarding Assistant**: AI chatbots providing contextual help based on onboarding progress, role requirements, and commonly asked questions
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: AI systems creating customized curricula based on individual skill assessments, learning preferences, and career objectives
- **Smart Access Provisioning**: Predictive AI that pre-provisions access to systems and tools based on role patterns and project assignments
- **Knowledge Discovery**: AI that surfaces relevant documentation, experts, and resources based on current learning context and questions
