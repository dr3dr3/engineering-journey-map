# 16. Observe and Support

Responding to production incidents, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating resolution efforts.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we respond to production incidents quickly while maintaining proper communication and coordination?
- How do we troubleshoot complex distributed system issues efficiently under time pressure?
- How do we coordinate incident response across multiple teams with different expertise and responsibilities?
- How do we maintain customer communication and manage expectations during incident resolution?
- How do we learn from incidents and implement preventive measures to avoid similar issues?
- How do we balance incident response with ongoing development work and business operations?

## Actions

- Respond to monitoring alerts and customer-reported issues following established incident response procedures
- Investigate and troubleshoot production issues using monitoring data, logs, and diagnostic tools
- Coordinate incident response activities across multiple teams and escalate issues appropriately
- Communicate incident status and progress to customers, stakeholders, and business leadership
- Implement temporary workarounds and fixes to restore service availability while investigating root causes
- Document incident timeline, resolution steps, and lessons learned for future prevention and improvement
- Conduct post-incident reviews and implement corrective actions to prevent similar issues
- Maintain incident response procedures and ensure team members are trained on emergency response protocols

## Challenges

- Managing high-stress incident response while maintaining clear thinking and effective communication
- Troubleshooting complex distributed system failures with limited time and incomplete information
- Coordinating multiple teams with different priorities and availability during critical incident response
- Balancing immediate incident resolution with thorough investigation and proper documentation
- Maintaining customer confidence and managing business impact during extended incident resolution
- Learning from incidents effectively while managing the emotional and professional stress of production issues
