# 10. QA Pre-Production

Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we validate system behavior in environments that closely mirror production conditions?
- How do we test disaster recovery and business continuity procedures before production deployment?
- How do we validate performance characteristics under realistic production load scenarios?
- How do we ensure security controls and compliance requirements are properly implemented?
- How do we coordinate final validation activities across all stakeholder groups?
- How do we make confident go/no-go decisions based on comprehensive pre-production validation?

## Actions

- Execute comprehensive smoke tests and critical path validation in production-like environments
- Perform disaster recovery testing including backup restoration and failover procedures
- Validate monitoring, alerting, and observability systems are properly configured and functional
- Test production deployment procedures and rollback capabilities in staging environments
- Execute security validation including penetration testing and vulnerability assessments
- Validate compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards
- Coordinate go-live readiness reviews with all stakeholder groups and technical teams
- Document production readiness assessment and obtain formal approval for production deployment

## Challenges

- Ensuring pre-production environments accurately represent production infrastructure and configurations
- Coordinating comprehensive testing across multiple teams while maintaining release schedule commitments
- Validating disaster recovery procedures without impacting production systems or business operations
- Managing the complexity of production-like testing scenarios with realistic data and user loads
- Balancing thoroughness of pre-production validation with time-to-market pressures and business deadlines
- Ensuring all stakeholders have confidence in production readiness based on testing results

## Interactions

- Release Manager: Coordinating go-live activities and managing production deployment approval processes
- Site Reliability Engineer: Validating system reliability, monitoring, and operational readiness for production
- Security Engineer: Conducting final security validation and ensuring compliance with security standards
- Database Administrator: Validating database performance and backup/recovery procedures for production workloads
- Network Administrator: Ensuring network configurations and security controls are properly implemented
- Business Stakeholders: Providing final business approval for production release based on validation results
- Operations Team: Coordinating operational readiness and support procedures for post-deployment monitoring

## Touchpoints
