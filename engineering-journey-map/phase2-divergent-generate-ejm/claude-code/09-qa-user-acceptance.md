# 9. QA User Acceptance

Validating software meets business requirements and user expectations with stakeholder involvement.

## Journey Step Focus

- How do we ensure software functionality aligns with business requirements and user expectations?
- How do we facilitate effective stakeholder participation in acceptance testing processes?
- How do we validate user experience and usability across different user personas and scenarios?
- How do we test business processes and workflows in realistic scenarios with actual business users?
- How do we manage feedback collection and incorporation from non-technical stakeholders?
- How do we ensure acceptance criteria are met before declaring features ready for production release?

## Actions

- Coordinate user acceptance testing sessions with business stakeholders and end users
- Execute business process validation with realistic scenarios and actual business data
- Facilitate usability testing sessions focusing on user experience and interface design
- Validate accessibility compliance and ensure software meets accessibility standards and requirements
- Test software functionality against original business requirements and acceptance criteria
- Collect and analyze user feedback on functionality, performance, and overall user experience
- Document acceptance test results and coordinate sign-off processes with business stakeholders
- Validate training materials and user documentation accuracy for end-user adoption

## Challenges

- Coordinating schedules with busy business stakeholders who have limited availability for testing
- Translating technical testing results into business language that stakeholders can understand and evaluate
- Managing conflicting feedback from different user groups with varying priorities and preferences
- Ensuring representative user testing across different personas, skill levels, and usage scenarios
- Balancing comprehensive acceptance testing with time constraints and release deadlines
- Getting meaningful feedback from users who may not understand technical limitations or possibilities
