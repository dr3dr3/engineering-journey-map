# 13. Release to Customers

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we control feature rollouts and reduce customer risk?
- How do we collect early feedback and measure feature impact?

## Actions
- Use feature flags for staged rollouts and experiments
- Monitor adoption, error rates, and business metrics
- Collect user feedback and support tickets linked to releases
- Gradually expand exposure, validating health at each step

## Challenges
- Feature flags drift and stale toggles increasing complexity
- Measuring causality between changes and metrics
- Managing multiple concurrent rollouts safely

## Interactions
- Product & Growth: experiments, metrics, and A/B targeting
- Support/Customer Success: user reports and feedback loops
- Observability: feature-specific dashboards and alerting

## Touchpoints
- **Feature Flagging System**: targeting, rollout, and analytics
- **Analytics/Telemetry**: user events, funnels, and KPIs
- **Support Platforms**: triage and tagging of release-related issues

## Feeling
- ðŸ“ˆ Optimistic â€” seeing positive adoption signals
- ðŸ˜¬ Cautious â€” watching error spikes and regressions

## Opportunities
- Automate flag lifecycle: create, monitor, and retire toggles
- Tie flags to experiments and metric validation pipelines
- Provide a single dashboard for active rollouts and owners

## Potential for AI
- **Flag Lifecycle Manager**: surface stale flags and suggest retirement timing.
- **Experiment Analyst**: correlate rollout phases with user metrics and anomalies.
