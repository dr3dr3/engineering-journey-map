# 3. Architecture and Design

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we design for reliability, scalability, and operability?
- How do we choose bounded, maintainable components and contracts?
- How do we plan for failure, degradations, and recovery?
- How do we document decisions and trade-offs clearly?

## Actions
- Define high-level architecture and component boundaries
- Produce sequence diagrams, data flows, and interface contracts
- Identify critical failure modes and mitigation strategies
- Specify SLA/SLI targets and monitoring points
- Review security, compliance, and data residency needs

## Challenges
- Over-architecting vs. short-term expediency
- Missing operational concerns (observability, backups)
- Poorly documented decisions leading to rework
- Integration complexity across teams and services

## Interactions
- Solutions Architects: validate designs against non-functional needs
- Security: threat models and data protection constraints
- Platform/Infra: infrastructure patterns, templates, and limits
- Developers: ensure APIs and contracts are implementable

## Touchpoints
- **Architecture Decision Records (ADR)**: record trade-offs and rationale
- **Diagram Repositories**: canonical system diagrams and flows
- **Monitoring/Tracing**: define SLI/SLA and instrumentation points
- **IaC Repos**: modules, patterns, and constraints

## Feeling
- ðŸ’¡ Confident â€” when constraints and goals are clear
- ðŸ˜¬ Concerned â€” about unknown failure points and scale
- ðŸ“š Responsible â€” for documenting decisions for future teams

## Opportunities
- Make operability first-class: include SLOs and playbooks early
- Standardize reusable architectural patterns (micro-frontends, services)
- Use ADRs consistently and link them to code and IaC

## Potential for AI
- **Design Reviewer**: automated checklist that flags missing operational controls, SLOs, or tracing hooks.
- **Trade-off Simulator**: model cost/latency/reliability implications of design choices.
