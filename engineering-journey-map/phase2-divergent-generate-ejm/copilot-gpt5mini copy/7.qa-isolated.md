# 7. QA Isolated

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we validate individual features in controlled environments?
- How do we ensure test isolation and deterministic test outcomes?

## Actions
- Run component and integration tests in isolated environments
- Validate feature flags and toggles in isolation
- Execute contract and compatibility tests
- Log and triage defects with reproducible steps

## Challenges
- Test environment setup and data isolation
- Incomplete mocks leading to false positives/negatives
- Delays in environment provisioning for isolated tests

## Interactions
- QA Engineers: design and run targeted test suites
- Developers: provide hooks and test doubles for isolation
- Platform: ensure environment templates and quotas

## Touchpoints
- **Mocking Frameworks**: service doubles and contract testing
- **Test Environments**: ephemeral sandboxes and containerized runs
- **CI Pipelines**: gating PRs with isolated test stages

## Feeling
- âœ… Confident â€” when isolated tests reliably catch regressions
- ðŸ˜• Frustrated â€” when mocks diverge from production behavior

## Opportunities
- Improve contract testing and consumer-driven contracts
- Provide fast, ephemeral environments and reliable test data
- Monitor mock fidelity and automatically update stubs from prod

## Potential for AI
- **Contract Generator**: infer contracts from traffic and auto-generate tests.
- **Environment Composer**: auto-provision minimal envs for a given PR.
