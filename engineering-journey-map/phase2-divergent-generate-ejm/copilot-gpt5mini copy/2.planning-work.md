# 2. Planning Work

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we define clear, testable requirements?
- How do we balance scope, risk, and delivery timelines?
- How do we break work into valuable, estimable stories?
- How do we align engineering, product, and ops early?

## Actions
- Clarify acceptance criteria and non-functional requirements
- Break epics into stories and tasks with estimates
- Identify dependencies, risks, and rollback strategies
- Create CI/CD and testing acceptance gates
- Schedule design reviews and spike investigations

## Challenges
- Vague requirements and shifting priorities
- Underestimated integration or operational work
- Missing success metrics or observability plans
- Late discovery of security or compliance constraints

## Interactions
- Product: clarify business goals and acceptance
- Architects: validate alignment with system design
- Platform/DevOps: surface deployment and infra needs
- QA/Test Engineers: plan test strategy and automation

## Touchpoints
- **Issue tracker**: stories, labels, and milestones
- **Architecture docs**: diagrams and component contracts
- **Roadmap/OKRs**: alignment to company objectives
- **CI/CD & Test Environments**: plan for staging and canaries

## Feeling
- 🔍 Focused — trying to reduce ambiguity
- 😟 Anxious — fear of missed operational effort
- 👍 Empowered — when acceptance criteria and tests are clear

## Opportunities
- Embed operability and observability requirements into every story
- Use templates that require deployment and rollback plans
- Run planning with a platform representative for infra impact

## Potential for AI
- **Acceptance Criteria Generator**: convert high-level requirements into testable acceptance scenarios.
- **Dependency Risk Scanner**: analyze code and infra to flag hidden dependencies.
