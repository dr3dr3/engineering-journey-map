# 16. Observe and Support

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we respond to incidents and restore service quickly?
- How do we coordinate cross-functional response and post-incident learning?

## Actions
- Triage alerts and stabilize impacts via runbooks
- Communicate status externally and internally
- Create incident timelines, collect evidence, and work toward fix
- Run retros and create follow-up remediation tasks

## Challenges
- Poorly documented runbooks or unknown runbook owners
- Coordination overhead across teams during complex incidents
- Incomplete telemetry making root cause elusive

## Interactions
- On-call Engineers: initial triage and mitigation
- Incident Commander / SREs: coordinate response and comms
- Product & Customer Ops: informing customers and PS teams

## Touchpoints
- **Incident Channels**: dedicated chat channels and war rooms
- **Runbooks & Playbooks**: step-by-step remediation guidance
- **Postmortem Tools**: RCA templates and action tracking

## Feeling
- ðŸš‘ Focused â€” urgency to restore customer experience
- ðŸ¤¯ Stressed â€” when multiple systems degrade or ambiguity remains

## Opportunities
- Keep runbooks small, well-tested, and linked to playbooks
- Run regular incident drills and game days to build muscle memory
- Capture blameless postmortems and ensure remediation tasks are tracked

## Potential for AI
- **Incident Assistant**: summarize key signals, suggest next steps, and draft comms.
- **Playbook Verifier**: run simulated incidents to validate runbook effectiveness.
