# 9. QA User Acceptance

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we confirm the product meets customer and stakeholder needs?
- How do we gather stakeholder feedback and acceptance criteria?

## Actions
- Run acceptance tests with business stakeholders
- Demonstrate features and capture feedback
- Validate edge cases, usability, and performance expectations
- Document sign-offs and open follow-up stories

## Challenges
- Misaligned expectations between product and stakeholders
- Demo environments that don't reflect real user data
- Late feedback that causes rework

## Interactions
- Product Owners: acceptance criteria and sign-offs
- Stakeholders/Customers: feedback and validation sessions
- QA: run acceptance suites and produce reports

## Touchpoints
- **UAT Environment**: controlled environment for stakeholders
- **Feedback Tools**: surveys, bug trackers, and notes
- **Release Notes/Diffs**: communicate changes and known limitations

## Feeling
- 🕵️‍♂️ Reassured — when stakeholder objectives are met
- 😬 Nervous — when demos expose unmet edge cases

## Opportunities
- Involve stakeholders earlier with prototypes and feature flags
- Provide replayable demo scenarios with real-ish data
- Capture structured feedback to feed into planning

## Potential for AI
- **Demo Assistant**: create guided demos and automated scenario playbacks.
- **Feedback Analyzer**: identify themes and map them to backlog items.
