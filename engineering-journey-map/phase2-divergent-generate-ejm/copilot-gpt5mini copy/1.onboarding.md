# 1. Onboarding

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we get engineers productive in days, not weeks?
- How do we ensure secure, least-privilege access to systems?
- How do we transfer domain knowledge and team norms efficiently?
- How do we provide early wins and clear learning paths?

## Actions
- Complete identity and access setup (SSO, MFA, org groups)
- Configure local dev environment (containers, dotfiles, secrets)
- Run first-build and first-test; open a simple PR
- Pair with assigned buddy/mentor; attend intro sessions
- Review runbooks, architecture overview, and on-call rotation
- Verify CI/CD access and run a pipeline job

## Challenges
- Access approvals and credential delays
- Out-of-date or scattered documentation
- Hard-to-reproduce local environments
- Unclear first contributions or low-signal tasks

## Interactions
- Identity/Platform Team: account provisioning and IAM
- Team Buddy/Mentor: onboarding help and cultural norms
- DevOps/Platform Engineers: dev environments and CI access
- Security: briefings on handling secrets and compliance
- People Ops/HR: administrative and compliance items

## Touchpoints
- **SSO & IAM**: account creation, roles, and groups
- **Git hosting**: repo templates, branch policies, CONTRIBUTING.md
- **CI/CD**: pipeline status, artifact storage, and runners
- **Developer Workspaces**: devcontainers, VMs, or cloud workspaces
- **Docs**: onboarding checklist, runbooks, architecture index

## Feeling
- ðŸŽ‰ Excited â€” eager to contribute and learn
- ðŸ˜¬ Nervous â€” too many systems and permissions to manage
- âœ… Confident â€” once first PR merges with mentor support

## Opportunities
- Provide a one-command dev environment (Dev Container / Cloud IDE)
- Maintain a short, curated first-issue list for newcomers
- Automate access via IaC-backed requests and approvals
- Ship a lightweight onboarding bot to verify steps and help

## Potential for AI
- **Onboarding Assistant**: conversational agent that verifies setup, opens issues for missing steps, suggests first-tasks.
- **Doc Gap Finder**: analyze commits/config to surface stale docs and recommend updates.
