# 11. Prepare Change

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we prepare formal change requests and approvals for production?
- How do we ensure safety and reversibility of production changes?

## Actions
- Create change tickets with risk assessment, rollback plan, and timing
- Coordinate approvals from stakeholders and platform owners
- Run pre-deployment checks and final smoke tests
- Schedule maintenance windows and customer communications

## Challenges
- Slow approval processes or unclear ownership
- Insufficient rollback or mitigation strategies
- Communication gaps that surprise customers or teams

## Interactions
- Change Advisory Board / Release Committee: approvals and sign-offs
- Platform/Infra: capacity planning and maintenance windows
- Product & Customer Ops: notifications and impact analysis

## Touchpoints
- **Change Management System**: tickets, approvals, audit trail
- **Maintenance Pages / Status**: customer-facing communications
- **Rollback Mechanisms**: feature-flag plans, blue-green, or canary strategies

## Feeling
- üìù Cautious ‚Äî responsibility for safety and customer impact
- üòñ Frustrated ‚Äî when approvals bottleneck timely releases

## Opportunities
- Streamline change approvals for low-risk changes with automation
- Require explicit rollback and verification steps for every change
- Provide transparent, automated customer communications for changes

## Potential for AI
- **Change Risk Assessor**: synthesize test results, code changes, and infra deltas to recommend approval level.
- **Automated Communication Composer**: draft customer-facing notices and runbook summaries.
