# 20. Continuous Improvement

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we regularly improve processes, tools, and outcomes?
- How do we make experimentation and measurement part of the culture?

## Actions
- Run retrospectives and capture actionable improvements
- Run small experiments (A/B tests, process changes) and measure outcomes
- Track key engineering metrics (lead time, MTTR, change fail rate)
- Share learnings and scale successful changes

## Challenges
- Retro fatigue or lack of follow-through on actions
- Measuring impact of process or tooling changes
- Organizational inertia to adopt small experiments

## Interactions
- Engineering Leadership: prioritization and resourcing of improvements
- Teams: continuously run retros and experiment cycles
- Data/Analytics: measure impact and validate hypotheses

## Touchpoints
- **Retrospective Tools**: capture outcomes, owners, and due dates
- **Metrics Dashboards**: lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR
- **Experimentation Platform**: to run controlled feature experiments

## Feeling
- üîÅ Hopeful ‚Äî when small improvements compound over time
- ü§∑ Skeptical ‚Äî if improvements aren't measured or sustained

## Opportunities
- Make experiments low-friction and time-boxed with clear success criteria
- Tie process improvements to measurable engineering metrics
- Reward teams for measurable improvements and knowledge sharing

## Potential for AI
- **Experiment Designer**: propose small experiments tied to measurable metrics.
- **Improvement Tracker**: correlate actions from retros with metric changes over time.
