# 12. Deploy Production

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we deploy with minimal customer impact and fast recovery?
- How do we observe deployments and detect regressions early?

## Actions
- Execute deployment (canary/blue-green/rolling) with monitor checks
- Watch automated health checks, SLOs, and synthetic tests
- Validate post-deploy smoke tests and rollout metrics
- Be prepared to pause/rollback on bad signals

## Challenges
- Unexpected runtime errors or regressions after deploy
- Insufficient real-time observability for quick decisions
- Coordination across teams for database or schema changes

## Interactions
- Release/Platform Engineers: run deployment tools and monitor
- On-call Engineers: triage alerts and runbooks
- Product/Customer Ops: customer comms and status updates

## Touchpoints
- **Deployment Orchestrator**: pipelines, feature flag services, and CD tools
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: SLOs, metrics, logs, and traces
- **Incident Channels**: Slack/ops channels for rapid coordination

## Feeling
- ðŸŽ¯ Focused â€” during the rollout and verification window
- ðŸš¨ Alert â€” if anomalies are detected and quick action is required

## Opportunities
- Improve automated rollback triggers tied to SLO violations
- Provide clear deployment dashboards and owner assignments
- Test and automate schema migrations safely with feature toggles

## Potential for AI
- **Deployment Watcher**: analyze real-time telemetry and recommend pause/rollback.
- **Blast Radius Estimator**: estimate impacted customer segments from deployment diffs.
