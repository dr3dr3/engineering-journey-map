# 18. Manage Tech Debt

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we discover, prioritize, and pay down technical debt?
- How do we balance delivery and long-term maintainability?

## Actions
- Catalog debt items with risk, cost, and owner
- Prioritize debt alongside feature work using impact scores
- Schedule refactor or upgrade sprints and accompany tests
- Track debt reduction progress and measure maintenance metrics

## Challenges
- Debt hidden in tests, infra, and documentation
- Difficulty quantifying ROI for debt repayment
- Competing pressure to deliver features over cleanup

## Interactions
- Engineering Managers: prioritize and allocate capacity
- Architects & Tech Leads: recommend refactors and modernization
- Platform: plan infra upgrades and migrations

## Touchpoints
- **Debt Register**: issue tracker with debt taxonomy and metrics
- **CI/CD**: tests and build-time checks to prevent new debt
- **Telemetry**: maintenance metrics, MTTR, and lead time for changes

## Feeling
- üò¨ Concerned ‚Äî about accumulating hidden costs
- üëç Relieved ‚Äî when debt is visibly declining and releases improve

## Opportunities
- Make tech-debt visible with explicit tickets and swimlanes
- Include debt remediation in definition-of-done and acceptance checks
- Automate detection (dependency rot, flaky tests, unused code)

## Potential for AI
- **Debt Detector**: analyze repos and infra for likely debt hotspots.
- **Refactor Planner**: propose minimal-safe refactor steps and tests.
