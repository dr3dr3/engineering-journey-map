# 14. QA Production

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we validate functionality in production without harming users?
- How do we detect regressions early with real traffic?

## Actions
- Run synthetic tests and smoke checks against production
- Monitor error budgets, SLOs, and key business metrics
- Triage production bugs into hotfixes or backlog items
- Run limited-impact experiments and shadow traffic tests

## Challenges
- Risk of tests affecting customer data or experience
- Noise in production signals and false positives
- Limited ability to reproduce issues without rich telemetry

## Interactions
- Observability/Monitoring: dashboards and alerts
- Support: incident reports and user-impact triage
- Engineers: patching and hotfix releases

## Touchpoints
- **Synthetic Monitoring**: uptime, transaction checks, and key flows
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry/Rollbar and log aggregation
- **Feature Flags**: emergency kill-switches and partial rollbacks

## Feeling
- üõ°Ô∏è Vigilant ‚Äî protecting customers and the service
- üòì Pressured ‚Äî when incidents have customer-visible impact

## Opportunities
- Expand canary and synthetic coverage for critical user journeys
- Improve telemetry fidelity and session-level context for debugging
- Automate triage to route likely production bugs to the right teams

## Potential for AI
- **Anomaly Identifier**: surface subtle degradations before they breach SLOs.
- **Root Cause Hypothesizer**: suggest likely causes using traces, logs, and recent deploys.
