# 15. Monitor

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we keep the system healthy and meet SLOs?
- How do we make alerts actionable and reduce toil?

## Actions
- Instrument services with metrics, traces, and logs
- Define SLIs/SLOs and error budgets
- Create meaningful alerts and runbook links
- Review on-call rotations and handover notes

## Challenges
- Alert fatigue from noisy or unprioritized signals
- Missing correlation between symptoms and root causes
- Insufficient data retention or sampling for investigations

## Interactions
- Observability/Platform Teams: dashboards, alerts, and tooling
- On-call Engineers: triage and mitigation
- Product/Business: understand SLA impacts and priorities

## Touchpoints
- **Metrics & Dashboards**: real-time and historical views of health
- **Tracing**: distributed traces for latency and error analysis
- **Alerting**: escalation policies and runbook attachments

## Feeling
- üõéÔ∏è Alert ‚Äî vigilant when thresholds approach error budgets
- üò§ Fatigued ‚Äî when alerts lack signal-to-noise or context

## Opportunities
- Reduce noisy alerts by tying them to SLOs and runbooks
- Enrich alerts with contextual links: deploys, commits, and traces
- Automate common mitigations and post-incident summaries

## Potential for AI
- **Alert Triage Bot**: group alerts, suggest severity, and link runbooks.
- **Incident Summarizer**: auto-generate post-incident writeups and RCA drafts.
