# 10. QA Pre-Production

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we validate readiness for production under realistic conditions?
- How do we test upgrades, migrations, and scalability before go-live?

## Actions
- Run smoke, regression, and soak tests in pre-prod
- Execute upgrade/migration rehearsals and rollback drills
- Validate observability: SLO dashboards, alerts, and traces
- Confirm ops runbooks and incident playbooks are up-to-date

## Challenges
- Capacity limits or quota constraints in pre-prod
- Differences between pre-prod and production data/traffic
- Last-minute regressions from late merges

## Interactions
- Release Engineers: coordinate cutover and schedule
- Platform/Infra: ensure pre-prod mirrors production constraints
- On-call/Support: run through incident playbooks and runbooks

## Touchpoints
- **Pre-Prod Cluster**: production-like environment for final validation
- **Runbooks & Playbooks**: operational runbooks for run-time support
- **SLO Dashboards**: production SLOs surfaced in pre-prod tests

## Feeling
- ðŸŸ¢ Confident â€” when pre-prod tests pass and runbooks are practiced
- ðŸ˜¬ Tense â€” if capacity or performance issues surface late

## Opportunities
- Automate pre-prod provisioning and consistent seeding of telemetry
- Run regular rehearsals for upgrades and incident drills
- Gate releases on observability and playbook readiness

## Potential for AI
- **Release Readiness Checker**: validate checklist items, test results, and SLO health automatically.
- **Rollback Predictor**: analyze deployment diffs to flag risky changes requiring stronger safeguards.
