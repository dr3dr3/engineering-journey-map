# 17. Assess and Feedback

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we collect, analyze, and act on customer and stakeholder feedback?
- How do we turn qualitative feedback into prioritized improvement work?

## Actions
- Collect feedback from support tickets, NPS, and user sessions
- Analyze trends and map to product or operational improvements
- Create experiments to validate hypotheses from feedback
- Communicate findings to product and engineering teams

## Challenges
- Feedback volume and signal extraction
- Measuring causality and long-term impact of changes
- Closing the loop with customers after fixes

## Interactions
- Support & Customer Success: raw reports and triage
- Product: prioritize and translate feedback to requirements
- Data/Analytics: provide quantitative measures and A/B analysis

## Touchpoints
- **Feedback Platforms**: ticketing, NPS, and product analytics
- **Session Replay & Telemetry**: correlate issues with behavior
- **Roadmap Tools**: surface high-value customer-requested work

## Feeling
- ðŸ”Ž Curious â€” eager to understand root causes of customer pain
- âœ… Rewarded â€” when feedback leads to measurable improvements

## Opportunities
- Automate feedback aggregation and clustering by theme
- Link customer impact to engineering effort in planning
- Share outcome reports with customers and stakeholders

## Potential for AI
- **Feedback Summarizer**: surface themes and prioritize based on impact and frequency.
- **Experiment Designer**: propose A/B test setups to validate fixes.
