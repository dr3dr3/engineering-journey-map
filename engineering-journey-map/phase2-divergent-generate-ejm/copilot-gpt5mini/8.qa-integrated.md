# 8. QA Integrated

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we validate interactions across services and teams?
- How do we find integration regressions before production?

## Actions
- Run end-to-end and integration tests across service boundaries
- Execute performance, load, and stability tests
- Validate monitoring, tracing, and alert rules in pre-prod
- Exercise deployment and rollback procedures

## Challenges
- Flaky or expensive end-to-end tests
- Environment drift and data consistency across systems
- Coordination overhead between teams for integrated tests

## Interactions
- QA Leads: coordinate integrated test plans
- Platform/Infra: provide integrated staging or pre-prod
- External Teams: validate public API contracts and SLAs

## Touchpoints
- **Staging / Pre-Prod**: production-like environments for integrated runs
- **Synthetic Tests**: user journeys and canary checks
- **Performance Labs**: load-testing tools and artifacts

## Feeling
- ðŸ”Ž Cautious â€” hoping integration tests reveal issues early
- ðŸ˜¤ Wary â€” when tests intermittently fail or are slow

## Opportunities
- Invest in resilient, fast E2E tests and better test slicing
- Use service virtualization and synthetic user journeys
- Automate environment provisioning and teardown

## Potential for AI
- **Test Prioritizer**: rank integration tests by risk and likely failure impact.
- **Synthetic Journey Designer**: generate user-journey tests from telemetry.
