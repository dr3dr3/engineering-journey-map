# 5. Local Development

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we write high-quality code with fast local feedback?
- How do we keep local environments close to production?
- How do we run deterministic tests and reproduce failures locally?

## Actions
- Implement features and unit tests
- Run local builds, linters, and unit test suites
- Use feature branches and open PRs with clear descriptions
- Debug with logs, traces, and local recordings
- Update docs and API contracts when changing interfaces

## Challenges
- Slow build/test cycles and poor local parity
- Secret management and safe testing against real services
- Unclear lint/style conventions and slow feedback loops
- Merge conflicts and long-lived branches

## Interactions
- Peer Developers: pair programming and code reviews
- CI/Platform: validate local-to-ci differences and runner specs
- Security: guidance for storing and accessing secrets locally

## Touchpoints
- **Dev Containers / Workspaces**: standardize local dev environments
- **Secrets Manager**: local mocks or short-living test credentials
- **Local Tracing / Logging Tools**: for reproducing distributed issues
- **Pre-commit Hooks & Linters**: enforce quality before PRs

## Feeling
- üßë‚Äçüíª Productive ‚Äî when builds and tests run fast locally
- üò© Frustrated ‚Äî when environment drift blocks progress
- Satisfied ‚Äî when CI validates PRs with predictable feedback

## Opportunities
- Provide optimized dev containers and caching strategies
- Offer secure, ephemeral test credentials and service mocks
- Enforce fast pre-commit checks and local parallel test runners

## Potential for AI
- **Local Debug Advisor**: suggests likely root causes from local logs and test failures.
- **Auto-PR Assistant**: summarizes changes, links tests, and suggests reviewers.
