# 6. Collaboration

## Journey Step Focus
- How do teams make sound technical decisions collaboratively?
- How do we keep code quality high through reviews and standards?
- How do we share knowledge and reduce bus factor?

## Actions
- Conduct design and RFC reviews
- Perform peer code reviews and automated checks
- Hold regular knowledge-sharing sessions and brown-bags
- Rotate ownership and document system knowledge
- Triage cross-team dependencies and integration efforts

## Challenges
- Inconsistent review quality and long feedback loops
- Knowledge silos and single points of failure
- Misaligned priorities across teams
- Merge conflicts and divergent code styles

## Interactions
- Product & PMs: align features to customer value
- Architects: ensure cross-cutting concerns are addressed
- Other Engineering Teams: coordinate integrations and APIs

## Touchpoints
- **Code Review Tools**: PR templates, checks, and CI comments
- **Knowledge Base**: shared docs, playbooks, and onboarding notes
- **Chat/Collab**: Slack/Teams channels and recorded discussions

## Feeling
- ü§ù Supported ‚Äî when reviews are constructive and timely
- ü•± Fatigued ‚Äî from noisy feedback or blocked approvals
- üîÑ Confident ‚Äî when processes keep delivery predictable

## Opportunities
- Standardize PR templates and required checks
- Encourage rotating ownership and mentor pairings
- Automate mundane review tasks (linting, dependency checks)

## Potential for AI
- **Review Summarizer**: auto-extracts key changes and test results for reviewers.
- **Knowledge Retriever**: surface relevant docs or past decisions during reviews.
