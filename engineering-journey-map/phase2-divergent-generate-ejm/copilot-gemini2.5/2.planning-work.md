# 2. Planning Work

Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we understand the customer problem we are trying to solve?
*   How do we break down large initiatives into smaller, manageable pieces of work?
*   How do we estimate the effort required to complete the work?
*   How do we prioritize what to work on next?
*   How do we ensure we have a shared understanding of the work to be done?
*   How do we manage dependencies between different pieces of work?

## Actions

*   Participating in backlog grooming and sprint planning meetings.
*   Reading and providing feedback on product requirement documents (PRDs) or user stories.
*   Breaking down user stories into smaller technical tasks.
*   Estimating the size or complexity of tasks using methods like story points or t-shirt sizes.
*   Collaborating with Product Managers and designers to clarify requirements.
*   Identifying and communicating technical dependencies and risks.
*   Committing to a set of tasks for the upcoming sprint or iteration.
*   Updating the status of work in an issue tracking tool.

## Challenges

*   Vague or ambiguous requirements that are open to interpretation.
*   Underestimating the complexity of a task, leading to inaccurate timelines.
*   Pressure to commit to more work than is feasible in a sprint.
*   Changing priorities mid-sprint, causing disruption and context switching.
*   Hidden dependencies that are discovered late in the development process.
*   Lack of clarity on the overall product vision or strategy.

## Interactions

*   **Product Manager:** Clarifying requirements, understanding business value, and negotiating scope.
*   **Engineering Manager:** Discussing priorities, resource allocation, and career development.
*   **Engineering Team:** Collaborating on task breakdown, estimation, and technical approach.
*   **UX/UI Designer:** Providing feedback on designs and ensuring technical feasibility.
*   **Quality Engineer:** Discussing testing requirements and acceptance criteria.
*   **Stakeholders:** Understanding the needs of other teams or departments.

## Touchpoints

*   **Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear):** Creating, updating, and organizing user stories and tasks.
*   **Project Management Tool (e.g., Aha!, Productboard):** Viewing the product roadmap and upcoming initiatives.
*   **Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** Reading PRDs and other planning documents.
*   **Communication Tool (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams):** Asynchronous discussions about planning and priorities.
*   **Whiteboarding Tool (e.g., Miro, FigJam):** Collaborative brainstorming and diagramming sessions.
*   **Calendar:** Scheduling and attending planning meetings.

## Feeling

*   ü§î **Thoughtful:** Analyzing requirements and thinking through technical implementation details.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working together with the team to create a plan.
*   üòü **Pressured:** Feeling the weight of deadlines and commitments.
*   ü§∑ **Uncertain:** When requirements are unclear or constantly changing.
*   ‚úÖ **Aligned:** When there is a clear plan and everyone is on the same page.

## Opportunities

*   Implement a "Definition of Ready" to ensure stories are well-defined before they are considered for a sprint.
*   Use historical data to improve the accuracy of estimations.
*   Dedicate time for "spikes" or research tasks to de-risk complex work.
*   Establish a clear process for handling and communicating priority changes.
*   Visualize dependencies between tasks to better manage them.
*   Hold regular roadmap review sessions to keep the team aligned with the bigger picture.
*   Encourage active participation from all engineers in the planning process.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Story Refinement:** An AI assistant that can analyze user stories for ambiguity, missing details, or undefined acceptance criteria.
*   **Automated Estimation:** AI models trained on historical data to suggest estimates for new tasks.
*   **Dependency Detection:** AI tools that can scan code and project boards to automatically identify potential dependencies between tasks or teams.
*   **Risk-Based Prioritization:** An AI system that can help prioritize the backlog by analyzing factors like business value, effort, and risk.
*   **Meeting Summarization:** AI tools that can automatically generate summaries and action items from planning meetings.
