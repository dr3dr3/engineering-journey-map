# 18. Manage Tech Debt

Systematically identifying, prioritizing, and addressing technical debt alongside feature development.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we identify and track technical debt?
*   How do we decide which technical debt is worth fixing?
*   How do we make time for fixing technical debt when there is pressure to deliver new features?
*   How do we communicate the business value of fixing technical debt?
*   How do we prevent technical debt from accumulating in the first place?
*   How do we create a culture where everyone is responsible for managing technical debt?

## Actions

*   Identifying technical debt during code reviews, architectural discussions, or incident post-mortems.
*   Creating tickets in the backlog to track technical debt items.
*   Estimating the cost of not fixing a piece of technical debt (e.g., increased maintenance costs, higher risk of bugs).
*   Prioritizing technical debt based on its impact and the effort required to fix it.
*   Allocating a certain percentage of the team's capacity in each sprint to fixing technical debt.
*   Refactoring code to improve its design, readability, or performance.
*   Upgrading to a new version of a library or framework.
*   Decommissioning an old or unused service.

## Challenges

*   It's difficult to quantify the business value of fixing technical debt.
*   There is constant pressure from the business to prioritize new features over non-functional work.
*   Engineers have different opinions on what constitutes "good" code, leading to disagreements about what to fix.
*   The amount of technical debt is so large that it feels overwhelming.
*   Fixing one piece of technical debt can have unintended consequences elsewhere in the system.
*   Lack of a clear owner or process for managing technical debt.

## Interactions

*   **Engineering Team:** Responsible for identifying, prioritizing, and fixing technical debt.
*   **Engineering Manager:** Advocating for the importance of fixing technical debt and creating space for it in the roadmap.
*   **Product Manager:** Working with the engineering team to balance the need for new features with the need to manage technical debt.
*   **Principal/Staff Engineers:** Providing guidance on architectural best practices and helping to identify the most critical areas of technical debt.
*   **Site Reliability Engineer (SRE):** Often a key stakeholder in fixing technical debt that affects reliability and performance.

## Touchpoints

*   **Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear):** The backlog of technical debt items.
*   **Code Quality Tool (e.g., SonarQube, CodeClimate):** A tool for automatically detecting code smells and other forms of technical debt.
*   **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):** Can be a source of information about why certain design decisions were made, which can help to inform technical debt discussions.
*   **Codebase:** The ultimate source of truth for technical debt.
*   **Tech Debt "Triage" Meeting:** A regular meeting to review and prioritize the technical debt backlog.
*   **Refactoring Tools:** Tools that can help to automate some of the work of refactoring code.

## Feeling

*   ðŸ˜¥ **Frustrated:** When you have to work around a piece of technical debt every day.
*   ðŸ¤” **Pragmatic:** Making a conscious trade-off between speed and quality.
*   ðŸ˜Œ **Satisfied:** After cleaning up a messy piece of code and making it better.
*   ðŸ’ª **Empowered:** When the team has the autonomy to manage its own technical debt.
*   ðŸ˜¬ **Worried:** About the long-term consequences of not addressing technical debt.

## Opportunities

*   Make technical debt visible by creating a dedicated backlog and tracking metrics over time.
*   Establish a clear, data-driven process for prioritizing technical debt.
*   Allocate a fixed percentage of each sprint to "engineering excellence" work.
*   Create a "tech debt amnesty" program where engineers are encouraged to identify and fix technical debt without blame.
*   Invest in training and tools to help engineers write better code in the first place.
*   Celebrate the successful removal of significant pieces of technical debt.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Tech Debt Detection:** An AI system that can analyze a codebase and automatically identify areas of technical debt, going beyond what traditional static analysis tools can do.
*   **Intelligent Prioritization:** An AI model that can help to prioritize technical debt by predicting its impact on things like development velocity, bug rates, and system performance.
*   **Automated Refactoring:** AI tools that can automatically refactor code to fix common types of technical debt.
*   **Tech Debt "Hotspot" Prediction:** An AI system that can predict which parts of the codebase are likely to accumulate technical debt in the future, allowing teams to be more proactive.
*   **Business Impact Analysis:** An AI model that can help to communicate the business value of fixing technical debt by quantifying its impact on key metrics.
