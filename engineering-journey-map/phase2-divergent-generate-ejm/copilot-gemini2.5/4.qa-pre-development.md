# 4. QA Pre-Development

Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts.

## Journey Step Focus

*   How do we ensure we have a clear and comprehensive testing strategy?
*   How do we define what "quality" means for a given feature or product?
*   How do we create effective test cases that cover all important scenarios?
*   How do we ensure we have the right test data and environments in place?
*   How do we integrate testing into the development process from the very beginning?
*   How do we align on the roles and responsibilities for testing?

## Actions

*   Reviewing product requirements and design documents to identify testable scenarios.
*   Creating a test plan that outlines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of testing activities.
*   Writing detailed test cases with clear steps and expected outcomes.
*   Identifying and preparing the necessary test data.
*   Collaborating with the Platform/DevOps team to ensure test environments are available and configured correctly.
*   Participating in backlog grooming and sprint planning to provide input on acceptance criteria.
*   Defining the different levels of testing required (e.g., unit, integration, end-to-end).
*   Automating test cases where appropriate.

## Challenges

*   Lack of clarity in requirements, making it difficult to define test cases.
*   Insufficient time allocated for test planning and preparation.
*   Difficulty obtaining or creating realistic test data.
*   Test environments that are unstable or not representative of production.
*   A "waterfall" mindset where testing is seen as a separate phase after development.
*   Ambiguity around who is responsible for different types of testing.

## Interactions

*   **Quality Engineer:** Leading the test planning and strategy efforts.
*   **Product Manager:** Clarifying requirements and acceptance criteria.
*   **Engineering Team:** Collaborating on the test plan and understanding their role in testing.
*   **UX/UI Designer:** Ensuring the user experience is considered in the testing strategy.
*   **Platform/DevOps Team:** Provisioning and configuring test environments.
*   **Data Team:** Assisting with the creation and management of test data.

## Touchpoints

*   **Test Case Management Tool (e.g., TestRail, Zephyr):** Creating, organizing, and tracking test cases.
*   **Issue Tracker (e.g., Jira, Linear):** Linking test cases to user stories and bugs.
*   **Documentation Hub (e.g., Confluence, Notion):** Documenting the test plan and strategy.
*   **Test Automation Framework (e.g., Selenium, Cypress):** Writing and managing automated tests.
*   **Test Data Management Tool:** Storing and provisioning test data.
*   **Environment Management Platform:** Requesting and managing test environments.

## Feeling

*   üßê **Meticulous:** Carefully thinking through all the possible scenarios and edge cases.
*   ü§î **Proactive:** Thinking about quality from the start, rather than as an afterthought.
*   ü§ù **Collaborative:** Working with the team to build a shared understanding of quality.
*   üò• **Frustrated:** When requirements are constantly changing, forcing rework of the test plan.
*   üí™ **Prepared:** Feeling confident that there is a solid plan in place to ensure a high-quality outcome.

## Opportunities

*   Adopt a "shift-left" approach to testing, where quality is a consideration from the earliest stages of the development lifecycle.
*   Implement Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) or Acceptance Test-Driven Development (ATDD) to improve collaboration and clarity.
*   Create a reusable library of test data that can be easily accessed and refreshed.
*   Automate the provisioning of test environments to make them more accessible and consistent.
*   Develop a clear quality assistance strategy that defines the roles and responsibilities of everyone on the team.
*   Use risk-based testing to prioritize testing efforts on the most critical areas of the application.

## Potential for AI

*   **AI-Powered Test Case Generation:** An AI assistant that can generate test cases from user stories or design documents.
*   **Test Data Generation:** AI tools that can create realistic and varied test data, including edge cases.
*   **Test Strategy Optimization:** An AI system that can analyze a project and recommend an optimal testing strategy based on factors like risk, complexity, and historical data.
*   **Acceptance Criteria Analysis:** AI tools that can review acceptance criteria for clarity, completeness, and testability.
*   **Environment Configuration:** An AI assistant that can help configure test environments based on the requirements of the application under test.
