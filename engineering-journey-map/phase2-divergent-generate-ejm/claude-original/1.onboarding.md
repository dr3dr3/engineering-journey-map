# Onboarding

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we get new starters up and running?
* How do we make it easy for new starters to start contributing?
* How do we onboard all Engineers to new practices and tooling?
* How do we ensure consistent onboarding experience across different teams/projects?
* How do we measure onboarding success and time-to-productivity?
* How do we maintain and update onboarding materials as systems evolve?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Setup the tooling they need and able to run our solutions locally
* Explain our codebases and technology stack
* Familiarize them with our ways-of-working (including values, culture, standards, practices)
* Complete security training and obtain necessary certifications
* Set up development environment with required IDEs, extensions, and configurations
* Review and understand architecture documentation and system diagrams
* Shadow experienced team members on real projects
* Complete first small task or bug fix to validate setup

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Getting access to the right tools and setting them up
* Not getting tools or access to things when others have it
* Documentation is outdated or incomplete for current system versions
* Overwhelming amount of information presented at once
* Inconsistent setup processes between different development environments
* Long wait times for account provisioning and system access
* Difficulty finding the right person to ask specific technical questions

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Working with Cloud/IT to get access to various resources
* Onboarding buddy/mentor assigned to guide through first weeks
* Team lead for project assignments and technical guidance
* HR for administrative setup and company policies
* Security team for access controls and compliance training
* Senior engineers for code reviews and technical mentoring
* DevOps/Platform team for infrastructure and deployment processes

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Identity and Access Management (IAM) systems for account setup
* Version control systems (Git repositories, branching strategies)
* Development environments (local, staging, testing)
* Documentation platforms (wikis, knowledge bases)
* Communication tools (Slack, Teams, email systems)
* Monitoring and logging platforms for observability
* Project management and ticketing systems

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜¤ Difficult to setup services to run locally (for dev/testing purposes)
* ðŸ˜° Overwhelmed by the amount of new information and systems
* ðŸ˜• Frustrated by lengthy approval processes for basic access
* ðŸ¤” Uncertain about where to find answers to specific questions
* ðŸ˜Š Excited to start contributing but worried about making mistakes
* ðŸ˜Ÿ Eager to learn but concerned about keeping up with team pace

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Tools for Software Engineers and QA Engineers
* Standardized development environment containers/templates
* Interactive onboarding checklists with progress tracking
* Self-service portals for common access requests
* Automated testing of onboarding documentation accuracy
* Peer mentoring programs and knowledge sharing sessions
* Video tutorials and recorded walkthroughs for complex setup processes

## Potential for AI

* **Automated Environment Setup**: AI-powered scripts that can analyze system configurations and automatically set up development environments tailored to each engineer's role and project requirements
* **Intelligent Onboarding Assistant**: AI chatbots that can answer common onboarding questions, guide new starters through setup processes, and provide contextual help based on their progress
* **Personalized Learning Paths**: AI systems that assess individual skill levels and create customized onboarding curricula, adapting based on learning pace and comprehension
* **Code Navigation and Understanding**: AI-powered code exploration tools that can explain complex codebases, identify key components, and suggest relevant documentation or examples
* **Automated Documentation Generation**: AI that keeps onboarding documentation up-to-date by analyzing code changes and generating relevant explanations and setup instructions
* **Smart Access Provisioning**: AI systems that can predict and pre-provision required access and tools based on role, team, and project assignments, reducing delays in getting started
