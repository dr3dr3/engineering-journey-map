# Manage technical debt

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we systematically identify, assess, and catalog technical debt across our codebase?
* How do we prioritize technical debt based on impact, value, and business risk?
* How do we integrate technical debt reduction work alongside feature development and delivery?
* How do we measure and track technical debt accumulation and reduction over time?
* How do we communicate technical debt impact and ROI to stakeholders and leadership?
* How do we prevent new technical debt from being introduced during development?
* How do we balance technical debt with security, compliance, and performance requirements?
* How do we coordinate technical debt management across multiple teams and codebases?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Systematically identify and catalog technical debt through code reviews, static analysis tools, and structured team feedback sessions
* Assess the quantitative impact of technical debt on development velocity, system maintainability, and operational costs
* Prioritize technical debt items using frameworks that consider business impact, technical risk, effort required, and team capacity
* Plan and schedule technical debt reduction work strategically alongside feature development using time allocation methods
* Execute targeted refactoring of legacy code, update critical dependencies, and incrementally improve system architecture
* Document technical debt decisions, rationale, and create actionable improvement roadmaps with clear success criteria
* Monitor and track metrics related to code quality, performance, developer productivity, and technical debt trends over time
* Build business cases and advocate for dedicated time and resources to address critical technical debt with stakeholder buy-in

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Competing priorities between new feature development and technical debt reduction
* Difficulty quantifying the business value and ROI of technical debt work
* Resistance from stakeholders who prefer visible feature delivery over "invisible" improvements
* Managing technical debt across large, complex codebases with multiple teams
* Balancing short-term delivery pressure with long-term system health
* Convincing leadership to allocate time and resources for technical debt reduction
* Coordinating technical debt work across teams without disrupting ongoing projects
* Measuring and communicating the impact of technical debt on business outcomes

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Development teams to identify, assess, and prioritize technical debt items
* Product managers to balance technical debt work with feature development priorities
* Engineering leadership and architects for strategic technical direction
* Project managers to plan and schedule technical debt reduction work
* Quality assurance teams to validate improvements and prevent regression
* DevOps teams for infrastructure and deployment-related technical debt
* Business stakeholders to communicate impact and justify resource allocation
* Security teams for addressing security-related technical debt and vulnerabilities

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Code analysis and quality tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate, ESLint)
* Issue tracking and project management systems for technical debt backlog management
* Documentation platforms for recording technical debt and improvement plans
* Version control systems for tracking code changes and refactoring efforts
* Continuous integration/deployment tools for automating quality checks
* Performance monitoring tools to measure impact of technical debt on system performance
* Dependency management tools for tracking outdated libraries and security vulnerabilities
* Architecture documentation and design tools for planning system improvements

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜¤ Frustrated by the constant accumulation of technical debt and competing priorities
* ðŸ˜Œ Satisfied when successfully refactoring code and improving system maintainability
* ðŸ¤” Challenged by the need to articulate business value of technical improvements
* ðŸ˜µ Sometimes overwhelmed by the scale of technical debt across large systems
* ðŸ¤— Motivated by the long-term benefits of cleaner, more maintainable code
* ðŸ˜Ÿ Concerned about the impact of technical debt on team productivity and morale
* ðŸ˜Š Proud when technical debt reduction leads to measurable improvements in development velocity

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Develop automated technical debt detection and tracking systems
* Create standardized frameworks for measuring and prioritizing technical debt
* Implement regular "tech debt sprints" or dedicated refactoring time
* Establish clear metrics and KPIs to demonstrate the business value of technical debt reduction
* Develop better tools for visualizing technical debt impact on development velocity
* Create cross-team collaboration frameworks for coordinated technical debt management
* Implement preventive measures and coding standards to minimize future technical debt
* Establish governance processes for making informed technical debt decisions during development

## Potential for AI

* **Automated Debt Detection**: AI that continuously scans codebases to identify technical debt patterns, code smells, and maintenance hotspots without manual analysis
* **Impact Assessment AI**: AI systems that quantify the business impact of technical debt by analyzing development velocity, bug rates, and maintenance costs
* **Smart Prioritization**: AI that prioritizes technical debt items based on impact, effort, team capacity, and business value to optimize refactoring decisions
* **Predictive Debt Analysis**: AI models that predict future technical debt accumulation based on development patterns and architectural decisions
* **Automated Refactoring Suggestions**: AI that suggests specific refactoring approaches and estimates effort required for technical debt remediation
* **Intelligent Planning**: AI that helps plan technical debt reduction work by identifying optimal timing and sequencing based on development schedules
* **ROI Calculation**: AI that calculates and communicates the return on investment for technical debt reduction initiatives to support business justification
* **Preventive Guidance**: AI that provides real-time guidance during development to prevent new technical debt from being introduced
