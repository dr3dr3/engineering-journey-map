# Planning Work

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we define and/or provide work to Engineering?
* How do we ensure requirements are understood by Engineers?
* How do we shape work by Engineering? (e.g. technical considerations)
* How do we determine and set priorities?
* How do we allocate work and manage cross-team dependencies?
* How do we scope and break down work (i.e. slice into stories)?
* How do we estimate work and align to team capacity (e.g. sprint planning)?

## Actions
What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Review and understand new requirements (i.e. as part of backlog refinement)
* Conduct technical feasibility analysis on requirements and/or solution designs
* Participate in architecture discussions and/or assist with solution design
* Ensure work is definition-of-ready prior to starting on it in a sprint
* Break down work into well-defined small work items (e.g. epics into stories and tasks)
* Estimate story points and timelines
* Planning work into sprints
* Updating stakeholders on plans and progress
* Managing impediments and blockers

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Amibiguous or incompolete requirements
* Want to ensure work planning sufficiently covers technical considerations and complexity
* Unrealistic deadline expectations from stakeholders
* Avoid disappointing stakeholders (i.e. deadlines, quality of work)
* Insufficient time allocated for technical discovery
* Missing non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability, etc)
* Pressure to commit to estimates without full context

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Product teams: Product Managers, Product Owners
* Business Analysts
* Architecture teams: Enterprise Architects, Solution Architects, Technical Architects
* UX/UI Designers
* Engineering Managers
* Other engineering teams (for dependencies and where collaboration is needed)
* Security teams
* Agile Coaches or those who define/manage/coach on ways-of-working

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Work management tools (Jira)
* Product management tools where requirements are defined (Aha)
* Architecture and design tools (Confluence)
* Knowledge management tools (Confluence)
* Collaboration platforms (Teams)

## Feeling / Experience

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ¤© Excited about new projects and technologies
* ðŸ˜° Anxious about unclear requirements and tight deadlines
* ðŸ˜¤ Frustrated about late changes to requirements
* ðŸ˜  Frustrated about lots of support issues to resolve
* ðŸ˜Ÿ Worried about accumlating technical debt that is not being addressed
* ðŸ˜© Stress about not meeting promised deadlines that we didn't set
* ðŸ˜“ Stress about feasibility of proposed timelines

## Opportunities
What could we improve or introduce?

* Adopt Agile practices (Scrum) for planning and managing work (ways-of-working)
* Define and agree a definition-of-ready (DoR) to ensure work is ready prior to commiting to a sprint
* Ensure non-functional requirements are considered as part of DoR
* Use spikes (task) for ensuring architecture / designs are completed prior to starting development work
* Use spikes (task) for clarifying technical considerations prior to starting development work
* Use spikes (task) for analysis and learning to help resolve complexity (prior to doing development work)
* Engineering teams empowered to do realistic estimation and provide guidance on timelines
* Foster a constructive close working relationship with Product and Architecture teams
* Better utilize collobaration tools between those Engineers interact with and Engineering
* Define and agree a definition-of-done that makes it explicit what is done (i.e. include non-functionals, testing, etc)

## Potential for AI

* **Intelligent Requirements Analysis**: AI that can analyze requirements documents to identify ambiguities, missing information, and potential conflicts, suggesting improvements before development begins
* **Automated Story Estimation**: Machine learning models that analyze historical data and story characteristics to provide more accurate effort estimates and identify estimation risks
* **Smart Work Breakdown**: AI that can automatically decompose epics into well-sized stories and tasks based on complexity patterns and team capabilities
* **Dependency Detection**: AI systems that analyze codebases and requirements to automatically identify cross-team dependencies and potential conflicts
* **Risk Assessment Automation**: AI that evaluates technical feasibility and flags high-risk items based on complexity, team experience, and historical delivery patterns
* **Requirement Gap Analysis**: AI that compares new requirements against existing system capabilities to identify technical debt, security implications, and non-functional requirement gaps
* **Predictive Planning**: AI models that can forecast realistic timelines based on team velocity, complexity patterns, and external factors like holidays or resource availability
