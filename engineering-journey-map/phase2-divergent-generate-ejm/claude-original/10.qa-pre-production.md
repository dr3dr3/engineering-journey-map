# Quality Assurance - Pre-Production

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we do final testing in preparation for deployment to Production environments?
* How do we only do the final testing needed (given prior testing outcomes)?
* How do we perform final validation in production-like environments before go-live?
* How do we implement risk-based testing focused on critical paths and high-impact scenarios?
* How do we validate performance, security, and scalability under production conditions?
* How do we verify deployment processes and rollback testing?
* How do we conduct configuration and environment-specific testing?
* How do we manage final sign-off and go/no-go decision making?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Execute smoke tests and critical path validation in production-like environments
* Perform load testing and performance benchmarking under realistic conditions
* Validate security configurations, certificates, and access controls
* Test deployment and rollback procedures with actual deployment artifacts
* Verify monitoring, alerting, and observability systems are properly configured
* Review and validate disaster recovery and backup procedures
* Conduct final security scans and vulnerability assessments
* Coordinate go-live readiness reviews with all stakeholders

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Balancing thorough testing with tight deployment schedules and deadlines
* Ensuring pre-production environments truly mirror production configurations
* Managing pressure to skip testing when previous phases showed good results
* Coordinating testing windows with production maintenance schedules
* Dealing with limited access to production-scale infrastructure for testing
* Handling last-minute configuration changes that require additional validation
* Making confident go/no-go decisions with incomplete information
* Managing stakeholder expectations about testing scope and timeline

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* DevOps and SRE teams for deployment procedures and infrastructure validation
* Security teams for final security clearance and compliance verification
* Production support teams to ensure readiness for post-deployment monitoring
* Release managers to coordinate deployment timing and communication
* Business stakeholders for final approval and go-live authorization
* Performance engineers for load testing and capacity planning validation
* Database administrators for data migration and backup verification
* Network and infrastructure teams for production environment readiness

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Production-equivalent staging environments with real data volumes
* Deployment pipelines and release management tools
* Monitoring and observability platforms (APM, logging, metrics)
* Security scanning and vulnerability assessment tools
* Load testing and performance monitoring platforms
* Backup and disaster recovery systems
* Configuration management and infrastructure-as-code tools
* Change management and approval workflow systems

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜¤ High pressure and responsibility as the final gate before production
* ðŸ˜Œ Confident in their thorough testing approach but nervous about unknown production variables
* ðŸ¤“ Focused and methodical, knowing that any missed issues could impact users
* ðŸ˜° Sometimes rushed due to deployment deadlines but committed to quality standards
* ðŸ˜Š Proud of their role as the final quality guardian before release
* ðŸ˜¨ Anxious about making the go/no-go decision with significant business implications
* ðŸ˜Œ Relief when testing passes but awareness that the real test begins in production

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Develop automated pre-production validation suites that run continuously
* Improve production environment mirroring with better tooling and processes
* Create risk-based testing frameworks that adapt scope based on previous test results
* Implement progressive deployment strategies (canary, blue-green) with automated validation
* Enhance collaboration tools between QA, DevOps, and production teams
* Develop better decision-making frameworks for go/no-go determinations
* Create comprehensive runbooks and checklists for pre-production validation
* Establish clearer communication channels for coordinating deployment readiness

## Potential for AI

* **Automated Risk Assessment**: AI that evaluates deployment risk by analyzing code changes, test results, and historical deployment outcomes to recommend testing scope
* **Intelligent Performance Prediction**: AI models that predict production performance characteristics based on pre-production testing results and system load patterns
* **Smart Go/No-Go Decision Support**: AI systems that analyze multiple data points (test results, metrics, risk factors) to provide evidence-based deployment recommendations
* **Automated Production Environment Validation**: AI that continuously compares pre-production and production environments to ensure configuration consistency
* **Predictive Load Testing**: AI that generates realistic load testing scenarios based on production usage patterns and anticipated user behavior
* **Intelligent Rollback Planning**: AI that automatically generates rollback procedures and validates their effectiveness based on deployment complexity and risk analysis
* **Smart Security Validation**: AI that performs comprehensive security assessments and identifies potential vulnerabilities specific to the production environment
* **Automated Readiness Verification**: AI that continuously monitors all deployment prerequisites and automatically validates that systems are ready for production release
