# Local Development

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we do development work (software engineering and QA work)?
* How do we approach doing development work?
* How do we write high quality, maintainable code?
* How do we implement features according to specifications?
* How do we ensure code security and compliance?
* How do we manage dependencies and technical debt?
* How do we collaborate effectively with remote/distributed teams?
* How do we balance speed vs quality in development?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Review and understand requirements/specifications before development
* Clone / pull / rebase code bases from repositories
* Write code, unit tests, and integration tests
* Commit code changes and push to remote / resolve merge conflicts
* Raise pull requests and conduct thorough code reviews
* Refactor existing code and address technical debt
* Debug production issues and performance bottlenecks
* Update documentation and maintain code quality standards

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Technical debt making changes difficult
* Complex build and deployment processes
* Frequent context switching between tasks
* Dealing with flaky tests and environments
* Insufficient documentation of existing code
* Pressure to cut corners to meet deadlines
* "Works on my machine" problems
* Keeping up with rapidly evolving technology landscape 

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Fellow engineers (pair programming, reviews, resolving issues)
* Quality Engineers (for testing strategies and bug resolution)
* Product Owners (for requirements clarification and prioritization)
* Platform teams (to resolve deployment and infrastructure issues)
* Security teams (for security reviews and compliance guidance)
* DevOps engineers (for CI/CD pipeline configuration)
* UX/UI designers (for implementation clarification and feedback)
* Technical writers (for documentation updates and standards)

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Development environments (dev containers, Docker / Docker Compose, IDE and setups)
* Version control (as managed in code and CI/CD pipelines)
* CI/CD pipelines
* Pre-production environments (including ephemeral environments if available)
* Code quality tools (linters, formatters, static analysis)
* Security tools (vulnerability scanning)
* Debugging and profiling tools
* Container platforms (Docker, Kubernetes)

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜Œ Satisfaction from achieving "flow state" when coding uninterrupted
* ðŸ˜¤ Frustration with technical debt and legacy code complexity
* ðŸ˜° Stress from constant deadline pressures and scope changes
* ðŸ˜Š Pride when features work as intended and receive positive feedback
* ðŸ˜¨ Fear from "imposter syndrome", especially when working on unfamiliar code
* ðŸ˜µ Overwhelm from information overload and rapid technology changes
* ðŸ˜ƒ Excitement when learning new technologies or solving complex problems
* ðŸ˜© Burnout from sustained high-pressure periods without adequate recovery

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Protected focus time for deep work and reduced meeting load
* Clear coding standards and automated quality enforcement
* Investment in technical debt reduction and refactoring
* Recognition for code quality and maintainability, not just speed
* Self-service environment provisioning and faster deployments
* Improved local development environments and IDE tooling
* Faster build and test execution for immediate feedback
* AI-assisted development and automated code review processes 

## Potential for AI

* **AI-Powered Code Completion**: Advanced code completion that understands context, patterns, and team coding standards to accelerate development and reduce errors
* **Intelligent Code Review**: AI assistants that can perform initial code reviews, flagging potential issues, suggesting improvements, and ensuring compliance with coding standards
* **Automated Debugging Assistance**: AI tools that can analyze error messages, stack traces, and code context to suggest potential root causes and solutions
* **Smart Refactoring Suggestions**: AI that identifies code smells, technical debt, and suggests specific refactoring opportunities with estimated impact
* **Automated Test Generation**: AI that can generate unit tests, integration tests, and edge case scenarios based on code analysis and usage patterns
* **Intelligent Documentation**: AI that automatically generates and updates code documentation, README files, and inline comments based on code changes
* **Context-Aware Environment Setup**: AI that can automatically configure development environments based on project requirements, team preferences, and individual developer workflows
* **Predictive Merge Conflict Resolution**: AI that can predict and suggest resolutions for merge conflicts before they occur, based on code patterns and team collaboration history
