# Collaborate on Development

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we collaborate effectively on development work across team boundaries?
* How do we work as a cohesive team on complex development tasks?
* How do we make technical decisions collectively and transparently?
* How do we make decisions as a wider engineering or technology organization?
* How do we establish and maintain consistent technical practices and standards?
* How do we share knowledge and promote shared understanding across teams?
* How do we conduct effective code reviews and technical discussions?
* How do we balance individual expertise with team collaboration?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Clarifying understanding across the team on requirements and technical specifications
* Collaborating on architectural decisions and problem-solving approaches
* Conducting thorough code reviews with constructive feedback
* Participating in pair programming and mob programming sessions
* Making collective decisions on implementation patterns and technical debt prioritization
* Facilitating knowledge transfer through documentation and mentoring
* Engaging in technical discussions during planning and retrospective meetings

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Siloed teams and organizational structures that limit cross-functional collaboration
* Remote working constraints that reduce spontaneous knowledge sharing and relationship building
* Difficulty maintaining up-to-date documentation and knowledge bases
* Limited time allocated for knowledge documentation and sharing activities
* Critical knowledge trapped in individual team members' heads without backup
* Conflicting coding standards and technical practices across teams
* Managing merge conflicts and code integration challenges in collaborative development

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Team members during daily development activities and code reviews
* Cross-functional engineering teams for shared component development
* Technical leads and architects for design decisions and standards
* Product owners and stakeholders for requirement clarification
* DevOps and platform teams for deployment and infrastructure collaboration
* Quality assurance teams for testing strategies and bug resolution

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Knowledge bases and wikis (Confluence, Notion) for documentation and standards
* Git repositories and pull request systems for code collaboration and review
* Integrated development environments (IDEs) with collaborative features
* Communication and collaboration platforms (Teams, Slack, Discord)
* Continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines for shared workflows
* Code quality and analysis tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate) for maintaining standards
* Technical forums and discussion boards for asynchronous knowledge sharing
* Pair programming and screen sharing tools for real-time collaboration

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜Š Connected when the team is performing well and collaborating effectively on challenging work
* ðŸ˜Ÿ Concerned about unknown unknowns due to lack of comprehensive documentation
* ðŸ˜” Lonely working remotely with limited opportunities to build meaningful relationships
* ðŸ˜£ Constrained by narrow focus areas that limit exposure to broader system knowledge
* ðŸ˜• Kept in the dark about important technical decisions and changes happening in other teams
* ðŸ˜¤ Frustrated when dealing with inconsistent coding standards or poor code quality
* ðŸ’ª Empowered when given autonomy to make technical decisions and contribute to architecture

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Establish comprehensive knowledge management practices with clear expectations and standards
* Implement definition-of-done criteria that includes documentation and knowledge sharing requirements
* Provide leadership support and dedicated time for documentation and knowledge transfer activities
* Create streamlined, valuable documentation practices that teams see as important rather than burdensome
* Introduce team member rotation programs to spread knowledge and reduce silos
* Ensure continued learning through varied work assignments across different technical domains
* Develop mentorship programs that pair experienced developers with those learning new areas
* Implement regular technical sharing sessions and brown bag presentations across teams

## Potential for AI

* **Intelligent Knowledge Capture**: AI that automatically extracts and documents insights from team discussions, code reviews, and technical decision-making processes
* **Contextual Knowledge Recommendations**: AI systems that proactively suggest relevant documentation, code examples, and team expertise based on current development context
* **Automated Meeting Insights**: AI that summarizes technical discussions, extracts action items, and tracks key architectural and implementation decisions
* **Code Knowledge Mapping**: AI that creates visual maps of code ownership, expertise areas, and knowledge dependencies to facilitate targeted collaboration
* **Intelligent Mentoring**: AI assistants that match team members for knowledge sharing based on complementary skills, experience levels, and learning objectives
* **Automated Documentation Synchronization**: AI that maintains current technical documentation by detecting code changes and suggesting relevant knowledge base updates
* **Cross-Team Collaboration Discovery**: AI that analyzes communication patterns and identifies opportunities for knowledge sharing between teams with related technical challenges
* **Smart Decision Documentation**: AI that automatically captures technical decisions and their rationale from team communications, making institutional knowledge searchable and accessible
