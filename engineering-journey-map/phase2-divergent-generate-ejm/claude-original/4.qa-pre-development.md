# Quality Assurance - Prior to Development

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we define testing scope for planned development?
* How do we plan and prepare testing for planned development?
* How do we adopt and practice test-driven development (TDD)?
* How do we ensure planned work meets our definition-of-ready?
* How do we assess and prioritize testing risks for upcoming features?
* How do we plan test environment requirements and dependencies?
* How do we define API and integration testing strategies?
* How do we incorporate security and performance testing considerations?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Conduct risk assessment and prioritize testing efforts based on impact and likelihood
* Create test strategy and frameworks aligned with project requirements
* Create comprehensive test plans and prepare detailed test cases
* Validate test environment readiness and resolve dependencies
* Design API and integration test scenarios for system interfaces
* Prepare and configure test harnesses and automation frameworks
* Source, prepare, and manage test data needed for comprehensive test execution
* Ensure testing approach aligns with test strategy, frameworks, and plans

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Lack of time or capacity for comprehensive test preparation and planning
* Complexity in creating or maintaining test harnesses and automation tooling
* Limited testing tools or inappropriate tools for specific project needs
* Communication and collaboration gaps between QA and development teams
* Unstable test environments affecting test reliability and execution
* Insufficient or poor quality test data management and sourcing capabilities
* Lack of clarity on acceptance criteria and requirement specifications
* Time pressures leading to incomplete test planning and limited test case coverage

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Product Owners: Clarifying requirements and acceptance criteria
* Software Engineers: Fostering shared understanding and collaborative test planning
* Business Analysts: Validating business logic and edge case scenarios
* Security teams: Reviewing security testing requirements and threat models
* DevOps/SRE teams: Integrating tests into CI/CD pipelines and deployment processes
* Platform teams: Support on testing environments (config, deploying, trouble-shooting)
* Platform teams: Support on setting up test harnesses, tooling, and test data management
* End users/stakeholders: Validating acceptance criteria and user experience expectations

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Test management tools (TestRail, Zephyr, etc) for test case organization
* Automated testing frameworks (Playwright, Cypress, Selenium, etc)
* Bug tracking systems (Jira, Azure DevOps) for defect management
* CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions) for test integration
* Static analysis and code quality tools (SonarQube, CodeClimate)
* Performance monitoring and APM tools (New Relic, DataDog, Grafana)
* Documentation platforms (Confluence) for test strategies and test plans
* Test data management systems, solutions, and automation tools

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜Š Pride about how well they understand both technical solutions and business requirements
* ðŸ™‚ Useful from providing valuable feedback and identifying gaps in requirements and acceptance criteria
* ðŸ˜µ Overwhelmed by tight timelines and competing priorities during sprint planning
* ðŸ˜Œ Confident when test coverage is comprehensive and well-planned with clear strategies
* ðŸ˜¤ Frustrated when requirements are unclear, incomplete, or constantly changing
* ðŸ’ª Empowered when provided with good tooling, clear processes, and adequate time
* ðŸ˜° Anxious about test environment stability and external dependencies
* ðŸ˜Š Satisfied with effective collaboration and communication across teams

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Optimize sprint capacity utilization by preparing future sprint QA work during early sprint phases
* Secure dedicated time allocation from leadership for strategic testing initiatives and framework development
* Implement comprehensive test data automation including backup/restore and anonymization processes
* Establish improved collaboration workflows and communication channels with development teams
* Enhance test environment management with automated provisioning and stability monitoring
* Develop risk-based testing prioritization frameworks to focus efforts on high-impact areas
* Create cross-team knowledge sharing programs and standardized testing best practices

## Potential for AI

* **Automated Test Case Generation**: AI that analyzes requirements and user stories to automatically generate comprehensive test cases and edge case scenarios
* **Intelligent Test Data Creation**: AI systems that can automatically generate realistic, anonymized test data that matches production patterns while maintaining privacy compliance
* **Smart Test Strategy Planning**: AI that analyzes project complexity, team capabilities, and historical data to recommend optimal testing approaches and resource allocation
* **Automated Test Environment Setup**: AI-powered infrastructure that can automatically provision and configure test environments based on project requirements and testing needs
* **Requirement-to-Test Mapping**: AI that automatically identifies gaps in test coverage by analyzing requirements and existing test cases, suggesting additional tests needed
* **Test Harness Optimization**: AI that can analyze testing workflows and suggest improvements to test harnesses, reducing setup time and increasing reliability
* **Predictive Test Planning**: AI models that predict testing effort and identify potential bottlenecks based on story complexity and team capacity patterns
* **Automated Acceptance Criteria Validation**: AI that reviews user stories and suggests missing or ambiguous acceptance criteria to improve test planning quality
