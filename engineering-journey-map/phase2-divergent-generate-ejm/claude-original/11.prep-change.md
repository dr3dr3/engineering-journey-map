# Prepare Changes for Production Deployment

## Journey Step Focus

* How do we do review and approve changes to Production?
* How frequently can we prepare changes for deployment to Production?
* How do we implement formal review and approval processes for production changes through governance frameworks?
* How do we document and assess risks of proposed changes and their impact?
* How do we coordinate deployment windows and scheduling with business requirements?
* How do we ensure compliance with organizational change management policies?
* How do we balance deployment frequency with risk management and operational stability?

## Actions

What do they do? What information do they look for? What is their context?

* Prepare comprehensive change requests with detailed impact assessments
* Document rollback procedures and contingency plans for deployment failures
* Coordinate with stakeholders to schedule deployment windows
* Compile evidence from testing phases to support change approval
* Review and validate deployment procedures and automation scripts
* Assess business impact and communicate with affected user groups
* Prepare Change Advisory Board (CAB) presentations and documentation
* Coordinate dependencies between multiple changes and teams

## Challenges

What are the challenges and pain points encountered?

* Preparing change for approval at Change Advisory Board (CAB)
* Deployment frequency is limited by the effort to prepare changes to Production environments
* Lengthy approval processes that slow down delivery of critical fixes and features
* Gathering comprehensive documentation while maintaining development velocity
* Coordinating complex dependencies between multiple teams and systems
* Balancing thoroughness of change documentation with time constraints
* Managing competing priorities for limited deployment windows
* Ensuring all stakeholders are informed and aligned on change impacts

## Interactions

Who do they interact with during this step?

* Change Advisory Board (CAB) members for formal approval processes
* Release managers and deployment coordinators for scheduling
* Business stakeholders and product owners for impact assessment
* DevOps and infrastructure teams for technical deployment details
* Risk management and compliance teams for governance requirements
* Communication teams for user and stakeholder notifications
* Support teams to prepare for post-deployment monitoring
* Security teams for security impact assessments and approvals

## Touchpoints

What part of the platform do they interact with? What platform services do they use?

* Change management systems and workflow platforms (ServiceNow, JIRA Service Management)
* Release management and deployment scheduling tools
* Documentation platforms for change requests and impact assessments
* Risk assessment and compliance tracking systems
* Communication platforms for stakeholder notifications
* Project management tools for coordinating change dependencies
* Configuration management databases (CMDB) for impact analysis
* Approval workflow systems and digital signature platforms

## Feeling

What are they feeling? What is the experience like?

* ðŸ˜¤ Frustrated by bureaucratic processes that seem to slow down valuable changes
* ðŸ˜° Anxious about providing complete and accurate information for approval
* ðŸ˜“ Pressured to balance thoroughness with urgent business needs
* ðŸ˜µ Sometimes overwhelmed by the complexity of coordinating multiple stakeholders
* ðŸ˜Œ Satisfied when well-prepared changes are approved smoothly
* ðŸ˜Ÿ Concerned about potential delays impacting business objectives
* ðŸ¤” Motivated to find ways to streamline processes while maintaining quality governance

## Opportunities

What could we improve or introduce?

* Make CAB processes more automated and less effort
* Implement risk-based approval workflows that expedite low-risk changes
* Develop standardized templates and automated documentation generation
* Create self-service change request systems with intelligent routing
* Establish emergency change procedures for critical fixes
* Implement continuous deployment practices with automated governance checks
* Develop better integration between development tools and change management systems
* Create predictive analytics to identify potential change conflicts and dependencies

## Potential for AI

* **Automated Change Impact Analysis**: AI that analyzes code changes and system dependencies to automatically assess potential impact and generate comprehensive risk assessments
* **Intelligent Change Classification**: AI systems that automatically categorize changes by risk level, complexity, and approval requirements, streamlining the CAB process
* **Smart Documentation Generation**: AI that automatically creates change request documentation, rollback procedures, and impact assessments from code and system analysis
* **Predictive Change Conflict Detection**: AI that identifies potential conflicts between multiple changes and suggests optimal scheduling to minimize risks
* **Automated Compliance Checking**: AI that validates changes against organizational policies, security requirements, and regulatory compliance automatically
* **Intelligent Approval Routing**: AI that routes change requests to appropriate stakeholders based on impact analysis, urgency, and organizational hierarchy
* **Smart Change Scheduling**: AI that optimizes deployment windows by analyzing business impact, system usage patterns, and resource availability
* **Automated Evidence Collection**: AI that gathers and compiles supporting evidence from testing phases, code analysis, and historical data to support change approval decisions
