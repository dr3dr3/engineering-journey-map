# 5. Local Development

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we implement features efficiently while maintaining code quality standards?
- How do we ensure our code integrates well with existing system architecture?
- How do we write comprehensive tests that validate functionality and prevent regressions?
- How do we debug and troubleshoot issues in local development environments?
- How do we follow coding standards and best practices consistently?
- How do we manage dependencies and keep development environments synchronized?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Writing feature code following established patterns and coding standards
- Creating unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end test automation
- Running local test suites and validating code quality metrics
- Debugging issues using IDEs, logging, and development tools
- Performing code refactoring and technical debt reduction
- Managing Git branches and preparing commits for code review
- Updating documentation and inline code comments
- Validating changes against acceptance criteria and Definition of Done

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Maintaining focus and productivity in complex, evolving codebases
- Debugging issues that only manifest in specific environment configurations
