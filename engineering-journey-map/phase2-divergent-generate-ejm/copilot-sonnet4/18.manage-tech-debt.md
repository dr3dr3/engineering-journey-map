# 18. Manage Tech Debt

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we systematically identify and catalog technical debt across our systems?
- How do we prioritize technical debt remediation based on business impact and risk?
- How do we balance technical debt work with new feature development requirements?
- How do we prevent accumulation of technical debt in future development work?
- How do we measure and communicate the impact of technical debt on productivity?
- How do we create sustainable practices for ongoing technical debt management?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Conducting comprehensive technical debt audits and assessment across codebases
- Creating technical debt backlogs with prioritization based on impact and effort
- Refactoring legacy code and improving system architecture incrementally
- Implementing automated code quality monitoring and technical debt tracking
- Updating documentation and improving code maintainability standards
- Planning technical debt remediation work within sprint planning and capacity allocation
- Educating team members on best practices for preventing technical debt accumulation
- Measuring and reporting on technical debt metrics and improvement progress

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Quantifying the business impact and cost of technical debt for prioritization decisions
- Securing stakeholder buy-in and resource allocation for technical debt work
- Balancing immediate business needs with long-term technical health requirements
- Managing the risk of introducing new issues while addressing existing technical debt
- Maintaining team motivation for technical debt work that may not be immediately visible
- Coordinating technical debt work across multiple teams and system boundaries
