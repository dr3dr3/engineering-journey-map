# 12. Deploy Production

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we execute production deployments safely with minimal downtime and risk?
- How do we monitor system health and performance during deployment activities?
- How do we coordinate deployment activities across multiple teams and systems?
- How do we validate that deployments are successful and systems are functioning correctly?
- How do we respond quickly to issues and execute rollback procedures if necessary?
- How do we maintain clear communication with stakeholders throughout the deployment process?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Executing deployment procedures following approved change management processes
- Monitoring system metrics, performance, and error rates during deployment
- Coordinating blue-green or canary deployments for gradual traffic migration
- Validating deployment success through automated testing and health checks
- Communicating deployment status and progress to stakeholders and operations teams
- Monitoring user feedback and support channels for deployment-related issues
- Executing rollback procedures if critical issues are detected
- Documenting deployment outcomes and any deviations from planned procedures

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Managing deployment complexity across distributed systems and microservices
- Coordinating timing and dependencies between multiple deployment activities
- Responding to unexpected issues under pressure and time constraints
- Maintaining system availability and performance during deployment windows
- Communicating effectively with stakeholders during high-stress situations
- Making rapid decisions about whether to proceed, pause, or rollback deployments
