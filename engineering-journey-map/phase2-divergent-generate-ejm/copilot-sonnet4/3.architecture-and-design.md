# 3. Architecture and Design

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we design scalable, maintainable, and secure system architectures?
- How do we ensure alignment with existing architectural patterns and standards?
- How do we balance technical excellence with time-to-market constraints?
- How do we design for observability, testability, and operational requirements?
- How do we document architectural decisions for future maintainability?
- How do we validate design choices through prototyping and proof-of-concepts?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Creating system architecture diagrams and component interaction models
- Designing API contracts, data schemas, and integration interfaces
- Evaluating technology choices and conducting trade-off analyses
- Writing architectural decision records (ADRs) documenting design rationale
- Creating proof-of-concepts and technical prototypes for validation
- Reviewing existing system architecture and identifying areas for improvement
- Defining non-functional requirements for performance, security, and scalability
- Planning database schema changes and data migration strategies

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Balancing over-engineering with pragmatic solutions that meet current needs
- Navigating conflicting requirements between different stakeholders and teams
- Working within constraints of legacy systems and existing technical debt
- Ensuring designs can accommodate future growth and changing requirements
- Managing complexity while maintaining system comprehensibility
- Achieving consensus on technical approaches across diverse team perspectives
