# 1. Onboarding

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we efficiently set up development environments and toolchains?
- How do we understand team practices, coding standards, and architectural patterns?
- How do we gain access to necessary systems, repositories, and documentation?
- How do we establish relationships with team members and key stakeholders?
- How do we understand the product domain and business context?
- How do we become productive contributors as quickly as possible?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Setting up development environments, IDEs, and required tooling
- Completing security training and obtaining necessary system access credentials
- Reading technical documentation, architectural diagrams, and codebase overviews
- Attending team meetings, stand-ups, and introduction sessions
- Completing assigned onboarding tasks and simple bug fixes
- Participating in code review processes as both reviewer and reviewee
- Setting up local development environments and running existing test suites
- Meeting with mentors or buddy system partners for guidance

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Information overload from extensive documentation and system complexity
- Difficulty navigating legacy systems and understanding historical technical decisions
- Slow or incomplete development environment setup due to tooling issues
- Unclear expectations about performance standards and delivery timelines
- Limited context about business requirements and customer impact
- Imposter syndrome and confidence issues when joining experienced teams

## Interactions

Who do the Engineers engage with during this step?

- **Direct Manager**: Regular check-ins on progress, goal setting, and performance expectations
- **Assigned Mentor/Buddy**: Daily guidance, answering questions, and providing technical context
- **Team Members**: Introductions, explaining team dynamics, and collaborative work sessions
- **DevOps/Platform Team**: Environment setup assistance and tooling configuration
- **Security Team**: Access provisioning, security training, and compliance requirements
- **Product Manager**: Understanding business context, user stories, and product roadmap
- **HR/People Operations**: Administrative tasks, benefits enrollment, and company culture orientation

## Touchpoints

Where do the Engineers interact with typical platform services during this step?

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Provisioning user accounts and role-based access controls
- **Version Control Systems**: Setting up Git repositories, SSH keys, and branching strategies
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Understanding build processes, deployment workflows, and environment promotion
- **Development Environment Tooling**: IDE setup, debugging tools, and local development stacks
- **Documentation Platforms**: Accessing wikis, API documentation, and architectural decision records
- **Communication Tools**: Setting up Slack, Teams, or other collaboration platforms
- **Issue Tracking Systems**: Understanding ticket workflows, sprint planning, and backlog management
- **Observability Platforms**: Access to monitoring dashboards, logging systems, and alerting tools

## Feeling

What feelings do Engineers experience during this step?

- ðŸ˜° **Overwhelmed** by the amount of information and systems to learn
- ðŸ¤” **Curious** about new technologies, architectures, and team practices
- ðŸ˜Ÿ **Anxious** about making mistakes or not meeting expectations
- ðŸ™‚ **Excited** about contributing to meaningful projects and working with new teams
- ðŸ˜• **Frustrated** by slow setup processes and technical roadblocks

## Opportunities

What opportunities are there for improvements to the actions in this step?

- Implement automated development environment provisioning using Infrastructure as Code
- Create interactive onboarding checklists with embedded tutorials and validation steps
- Develop role-specific learning paths with curated content and hands-on exercises
- Establish structured mentorship programs with clear goals and feedback mechanisms
- Build comprehensive knowledge bases with search functionality and regular updates
- Create shadowing opportunities for new engineers to observe experienced team workflows
- Implement gradual responsibility increase with well-defined milestone achievements
- Develop onboarding metrics and feedback loops to continuously improve the process

## Potential for AI

How can AI be potentially used to improve things for this step?

- **Intelligent Documentation Assistant**: AI-powered chatbot that can answer questions about codebases, architecture, and team practices
- **Personalized Learning Paths**: AI-generated onboarding curricula based on role, experience level, and team needs
- **Automated Environment Setup**: AI-driven configuration management that adapts to individual developer preferences and project requirements
- **Code Context Explanation**: AI tools that provide contextual explanations of complex code sections and architectural decisions
