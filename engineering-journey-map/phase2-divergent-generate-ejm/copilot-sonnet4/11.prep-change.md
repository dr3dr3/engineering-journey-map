# 11. Prepare Change

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we create comprehensive change requests that clearly communicate risks and benefits?
- How do we ensure all stakeholders understand the impact and scope of proposed changes?
- How do we plan deployment strategies that minimize business disruption?
- How do we prepare rollback procedures and contingency plans for potential issues?
- How do we coordinate change timing with business operations and customer expectations?
- How do we ensure compliance with organizational change management policies?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Creating detailed change requests with impact analysis and risk assessment
- Developing comprehensive deployment plans with step-by-step procedures
- Preparing rollback strategies and testing rollback procedures in staging environments
- Coordinating with business stakeholders to identify optimal deployment windows
- Reviewing change requests with Change Advisory Board (CAB) or approval committees
- Creating communication plans for notifying affected users and stakeholders
- Preparing monitoring and validation procedures for post-deployment verification
- Documenting emergency procedures and escalation contacts for incident response

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Balancing detailed documentation requirements with the need for rapid deployment
- Coordinating across multiple teams and stakeholders with different priorities
- Accurately assessing risks and potential impacts of complex system changes
- Managing change approval processes that may slow down development velocity
- Communicating technical concepts to non-technical approval authorities
- Scheduling deployments around business constraints and blackout periods

## Interactions

Who do the Engineers engage with during this step?

- **Change Advisory Board**: Presenting change requests and responding to approval committee questions
- **Business Stakeholders**: Coordinating deployment timing and communicating potential impacts
- **Operations Team**: Planning deployment procedures and operational handoff requirements
- **Security Team**: Reviewing security implications and compliance requirements
- **Customer Success**: Understanding customer impact and communication needs
- **Legal/Compliance**: Ensuring regulatory requirements and audit trail documentation
- **Executive Sponsors**: Communicating high-risk changes and obtaining executive approval

## Touchpoints

Where do the Engineers interact with typical platform services during this step?

- **Change Management Systems**: Using ServiceNow, Remedy, or similar for formal change request tracking
- **Documentation Platforms**: Creating comprehensive change documentation in Confluence, SharePoint, or wikis
- **Approval Workflow Tools**: Managing approvals through integrated workflow systems
- **Communication Platforms**: Coordinating stakeholder notifications through email, Slack, or announcement systems
- **Project Management**: Tracking change preparation tasks in Jira, Azure DevOps, or similar tools
- **Risk Assessment Tools**: Using risk analysis frameworks and impact assessment templates
- **Scheduling Systems**: Coordinating deployment windows with calendar and resource management tools
- **Compliance Platforms**: Ensuring audit trail documentation and regulatory compliance tracking

## Feeling

What feelings do Engineers experience during this step?

- ðŸ˜° **Anxious** about potential risks and the responsibility of production changes
- ðŸ˜¤ **Frustrated** by bureaucratic processes that may slow down development velocity
- ðŸŽ¯ **Methodical** when preparing comprehensive documentation and risk assessments
- ðŸ’ª **Prepared** when successfully completing thorough change preparation procedures
- ðŸ¤” **Thoughtful** when considering all potential impacts and mitigation strategies

## Opportunities

What opportunities are there for improvements to the actions in this step?

- Implement automated change impact analysis based on code analysis and system dependencies
- Create standardized change request templates with intelligent risk assessment prompts
- Develop automated approval routing based on change type and organizational policies
- Build comprehensive change calendar integration with business operations and maintenance windows
- Establish automated rollback validation with comprehensive testing frameworks
- Create real-time stakeholder notification systems with targeted communication strategies
- Implement change success metrics tracking with automated post-deployment validation
- Develop predictive models for estimating change risks and success probability

## Potential for AI

How can AI be potentially used to improve things for this step?

- **Automated Risk Assessment**: AI systems that analyze proposed changes and predict potential risks and impacts
- **Intelligent Change Categorization**: Machine learning algorithms that automatically classify changes and route to appropriate approval workflows
- **Predictive Success Analysis**: AI models that predict change success probability based on historical data and system complexity
- **Automated Documentation Generation**: AI tools that generate comprehensive change documentation from code and configuration analysis
- **Smart Scheduling Optimization**: AI algorithms that identify optimal deployment windows based on business constraints and system load patterns
