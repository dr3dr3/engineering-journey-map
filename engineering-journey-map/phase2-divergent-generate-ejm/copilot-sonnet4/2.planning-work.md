# 2. Planning Work

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we break down complex features into manageable, estimable tasks?
- How do we accurately estimate effort and identify technical dependencies?
- How do we prioritize work based on business value and technical constraints?
- How do we plan for quality assurance and testing throughout development?
- How do we align technical implementation with business requirements?
- How do we manage scope creep and changing requirements effectively?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Analyzing user stories and acceptance criteria for technical feasibility
- Creating technical task breakdowns and identifying dependencies between components
- Estimating effort using story points, t-shirt sizing, or other estimation techniques
- Participating in sprint planning, backlog refinement, and capacity planning sessions
- Creating technical spikes to investigate unknown or risky areas
- Defining Definition of Done criteria and quality gates for each story
- Collaborating with product managers to clarify requirements and edge cases
- Planning integration points and API contracts with other teams

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Incomplete or ambiguous requirements leading to estimation uncertainty
- Pressure to commit to unrealistic timelines without adequate technical investigation
- Difficulty estimating work involving unfamiliar technologies or complex integrations
- Balancing technical debt remediation with new feature development
- Managing dependencies on external teams and third-party services
- Coordinating work across multiple engineers and avoiding conflicts
