# 14. QA Production

## Journey Step Focus

What is the primary focus of the Engineers in this step?

- How do we monitor and validate production functionality after customer release?
- How do we detect and respond to production issues before they impact customers significantly?
- How do we ensure system performance and reliability meet service level agreements?
- How do we validate that production behavior matches expected functionality?
- How do we gather production data to inform future development and improvements?
- How do we maintain system health while customers are actively using new features?

## Actions

What actions are typically done by the Engineers during this step?

- Monitoring production systems for performance anomalies and functional issues
- Executing production validation tests to verify system behavior and functionality
- Analyzing customer usage patterns and identifying potential optimization opportunities
- Investigating and triaging production incidents and customer-reported issues
- Validating system performance against established SLAs and performance benchmarks
- Gathering production metrics and analytics to inform development decisions
- Coordinating with support teams to resolve customer issues quickly
- Implementing hot fixes and emergency patches for critical production issues

## Challenges

What challenges are typically experienced by Engineers during this step?

- Distinguishing between normal system variations and actual production issues
- Responding to production issues under time pressure while maintaining quality
- Balancing system stability with the need for rapid issue resolution
