# Architecture and Design

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we create scalable, maintainable solutions that meet current and future needs?**
- **How do we align technical design with business objectives and constraints?**
- **How do we ensure cross‑team consistency in patterns and standards?**
- **How do we balance innovation against risk and technical debt?**
- **How do we document design decisions for future reference?**

## Actions
1. Conduct a *solution architecture workshop* involving stakeholders, platform engineers, and security leads to outline high‑level components.  
2. Draft an *architecture decision record (ADR)* that captures the rationale, alternatives considered, and trade‑offs.  
3. Create detailed *component diagrams* (UML/PlantUML) illustrating interfaces, data flows, and dependencies.  
4. Define *API contracts* using OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas to enforce consistency across services.  
5. Review security implications: threat modeling, IAM roles, encryption at rest/transit.  
6. Validate design against capacity planning, cost models, and performance budgets.  
7. Iterate on the design through peer review sessions with cross‑team experts.

## Challenges
- **Complexity management** – avoiding over‑engineering while still covering edge cases.  
- **Stakeholder alignment** – reconciling divergent priorities between product, ops, and security.  
- **Documentation fatigue** – maintaining up‑to‑date ADRs in fast‑moving environments.  
- **Technology drift** – keeping design choices compatible with evolving platform capabilities.  
- **Interoperability** – ensuring new components integrate smoothly with existing services.

## Interactions
- **Platform Architect:** guidance on infrastructure constraints and best practices.  
- **Security Lead:** threat modeling, compliance checks, and IAM design.  
- **Product Owner:** clarification of business goals and feature priorities.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** insights into CI/CD pipelines, deployment patterns, and observability.  
- **UX Designer / Front‑end Lead:** ensuring API contracts meet UI needs.  
- **Data Team:** alignment on data models, storage strategies, and analytics requirements.

## Touchpoints
- ***Azure Architecture Center* / AWS Well‑Architected Framework*** – reference architectures and checklists.  
- ***PlantUML*** – generating component diagrams directly from code comments.  
- ***OpenAPI/GraphQL Spec*** – defining and validating API contracts.  
- ***GitLab Wiki* / Confluence*** – storing ADRs, design docs, and decision logs.  
- ***Static Analysis Tools (SonarQube)* – ensuring code meets architectural guidelines.  
- ***Observability Stack (Grafana, Loki, Tempo)* – validating performance expectations early.  
- ***IaC Repositories (Terraform/ARM/Bicep)* – provisioning infrastructure based on design decisions.  

## Feeling
- 🧩 **Strategic** – aligning technical architecture with long‑term business vision.  
- 🔍 **Analytical** – scrutinizing trade‑offs and risk assessments.  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** – engaging multiple disciplines to co‑create a robust solution.  

## Opportunities
1. Automate ADR generation templates that auto‑populate key fields from Jira tickets.  
2. Integrate an AI‑driven design checker that flags architectural violations against defined patterns.  
3. Deploy a *design review bot* in Slack that reminds teams of pending architecture sign‑offs.  
4. Offer interactive, live‑updating component diagrams that sync with codebase changes.  
5. Build a knowledge graph of past ADRs to surface precedent decisions quickly.  

## Potential for AI
- **Design Suggestion Engine** – proposes optimal technology stacks based on project constraints and historical success rates.  
- **Threat Modeling Assistant** – automatically identifies potential security gaps in the architecture diagram.  
- **Architecture Violation Detector** – scans code commits and infrastructure IaC to detect deviations from established patterns.  
- **Auto‑Documentation Tool** – extracts architectural intent from code comments and generates up‑to‑date diagrams.  
- **Decision Impact Analyzer** – simulates how changes to one component ripple through the system (cost, latency, security).
