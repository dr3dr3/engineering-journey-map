# QA Pre‑Development

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we define comprehensive test coverage before any code is written?**
- **How do we create reliable, repeatable test environments that mirror production?**
- **How do we align quality criteria with business expectations early in the cycle?**

## Actions
1. Conduct a *test strategy workshop* with QA leads and product owners to map out functional, non‑functional, and edge cases.  
2. Draft *test case templates* (BDD/Gherkin or JSON) that can be reused across stories.  
3. Identify and provision required data sets in a sandbox database using Terraform‑managed schemas.  
4. Spin up containerized test environments (Docker Compose or Kubernetes namespaces) that replicate production dependencies.  
5. Create automated *baseline performance tests* to set latency, throughput, and error thresholds.  
6. Define *quality gates* (e.g., code coverage > 80%, linting errors = 0) in the CI pipeline.  
7. Document all test artifacts in Confluence and link them to corresponding Jira issues.

## Challenges
- **Environment drift** – ensuring sandbox remains consistent with prod over time.  
- **Test data volume** – generating realistic, diverse data without impacting performance.  
- **Coverage gaps** – missing edge cases that only surface after implementation.  
- **Stakeholder alignment** – balancing QA depth against sprint velocity constraints.  
- **Tooling fragmentation** – integrating multiple test frameworks into a single pipeline.

## Interactions
- **QA Lead:** design of strategy, prioritization of test types.  
- **Product Owner:** definition of acceptance criteria and success metrics.  
- **Platform Engineer:** provisioning of shared services (DBs, caches).  
- **Security Analyst:** penetration‑testing scenarios and compliance checks.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** CI/CD pipeline configuration for automated testing.

## Touchpoints
- ***GitLab CI* / GitHub Actions*** – orchestrating automated test runs.  
- ***Docker Compose* or *Kubernetes**** – test environment provisioning.  
- ***Postman/Newman* (API tests)*** – functional API validation.  
- ***JMeter/Gatling* (load tests)*** – performance baseline creation.  
- ***SonarQube* (code quality metrics)*** – static analysis and coverage reporting.  
- ***Confluence* / Jira*** – documentation and traceability of test artifacts.

## Feeling
- 🛠️ **Prepared** – having a clear testing plan reduces uncertainty.  
- 🔎 **Diligent** – meticulous pre‑dev checks build confidence in quality.  

## Opportunities
1. Automate test environment provisioning via IaC to eliminate manual setup errors.  
2. Integrate an AI‑powered test case generator that proposes scenarios based on user stories.  
3. Deploy a *test coverage visualizer* that highlights gaps in real time during the sprint planning phase.  
4. Offer a “mock data factory” that seeds realistic datasets using synthetic data generators.  
5. Create a dynamic risk‑based testing dashboard that updates as new features are added.

## Potential for AI
- **Test Case Generator** – analyzes story text and produces BDD scenarios automatically.  
- **Environment Drift Detector** – compares sandbox snapshots to production to flag inconsistencies.  
- **Coverage Gap Predictor** – uses historical data to forecast potential coverage blind spots.  
- **Automated Test Prioritization Bot** – ranks tests based on risk, frequency of failure, and impact.
