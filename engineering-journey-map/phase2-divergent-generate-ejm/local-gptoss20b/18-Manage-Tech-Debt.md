# 18. Manage Tech Debt

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we** identify and quantify technical debt across the codebase?  
- **How do we** prioritize debt items against new feature development?  
- **How do we** integrate debt remediation into regular sprint cycles without disrupting velocity?  
- **How do we** communicate the value of debt reduction to stakeholders?

## Actions
1. Run automated static‑analysis scans (SonarQube, ESLint, FindBugs) to surface code quality issues.  
2. Perform architecture reviews and map legacy components that violate current design principles.  
3. Create a shared backlog category “Tech Debt” in Jira/Backlog with clear acceptance criteria.  
4. Schedule recurring “Debt Sprints” or embed debt tickets into regular development lanes.  
5. Track metrics (cyclomatic complexity, duplication %, test coverage) over time to gauge improvement.  
6. Conduct quarterly financial impact assessments comparing cost of debt vs. potential savings from refactor.

## Challenges
- **Visibility gaps**: hidden debt in production code that static tools miss.  
- **Stakeholder resistance**: pressure to ship features can deprioritize debt work.  
- **Scope creep**: refactoring often expands beyond the original ticket.  
- **Resource allocation**: balancing new feature capacity vs. maintenance budgets.  
- **Measurement uncertainty**: correlating reduced debt with tangible business outcomes.

## Interactions
- **Engineering Lead / Architects:** define quality gates and debt thresholds.  
- **Product Owner:** align debt priorities with product roadmap.  
- **SRE/Operations:** identify runtime performance debt from infrastructure or deployment scripts.  
- **QA/Test Engineers:** provide coverage metrics and regression risk analysis.  
- **Finance / Ops Managers:** approve budgets for refactoring initiatives.  
- **DevOps Automation Team:** integrate debt detection into CI/CD pipelines.  
- **Customers (via Support):** surface recurring issues that hint at underlying technical debt.

## Touchpoints
- **SonarQube / CodeClimate** – automated code quality dashboards.  
- **GitHub Actions / Azure Pipelines** – build‑time checks for debt thresholds.  
- **Jira/Backlog** – dedicated tech‑debt issue tracking and sprint planning.  
- **Confluence / Notion** – architecture decision records (ADRs) documenting debt decisions.  
- **Datadog/New Relic** – runtime metrics that may be improved by refactoring.  
- **Slack / Teams** – “Debt of the Week” channel for visibility.  
- **Financial Planning Tools** – cost‑benefit analysis spreadsheets or dashboards.  
- **Google Analytics / Mixpanel** – user impact metrics pre/post debt remediation.

## Feeling
- 🛠️ **Constructive** – a sense that every refactor is an investment in future productivity.  
- 🚧 **Cautious** – awareness that changing legacy systems can introduce new risks.  
- 🎯 **Goal‑oriented** – clear focus on measurable quality improvement targets.  
- 😖 **Frustrated** – when debt remains hidden or resists estimation.  
- 👏 **Accomplished** – completion of a major refactor yields tangible performance gains.

## Opportunities
1. Embed automated debt scoring into merge request reviews to surface issues before code lands.  
2. Create a “Debt Burndown” dashboard that visualises reduction progress per sprint or release.  
3. Introduce a “Refactor Voucher” system where developers earn tokens for completing high‑impact debt tickets.  
4. Leverage AI‑based static analysis to predict future maintenance costs associated with current code patterns.  
5. Align tech‑debt work with security compliance checks (e.g., OWASP Top 10) for double benefit.  
6. Conduct a “Shadow Sprint” focused exclusively on refactoring, then measure velocity rebound.  
7. Use machine‑learning clustering to group similar debt items and batch them efficiently.  
8. Publish quarterly tech‑debt health reports to senior leadership, framing it as a risk mitigation metric.

## Potential for AI
- **Debt Detection Assistant** – uses NLP to scan commit messages and code comments for hidden debt indicators.  
- **Impact Estimator** – predicts the downstream effect (e.g., bug reduction, latency improvement) of refactoring a module using historical data.  
- **Prioritization Engine** – ranks tech‑debt tickets based on business value, risk, and effort using multi‑criteria decision analysis.  
- **Automated Refactor Suggestion** – generates code patches that resolve identified static‑analysis violations while preserving semantics.  
- **Continuous Quality Coach** – monitors CI runs and nudges developers toward debt‑free commits by offering real‑time feedback.
