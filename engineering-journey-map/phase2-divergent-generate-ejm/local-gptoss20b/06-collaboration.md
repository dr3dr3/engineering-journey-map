# Collaboration

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we enable transparent, cross‑functional decision making?**
- **How do we share knowledge effectively during code reviews and pair sessions?**
- **How do we maintain alignment across multiple teams working on the same feature set?**

## Actions
1. Schedule a *collaborative design review* (e.g., live walkthrough in Zoom) that includes all stakeholders: engineers, product owners, QA leads, and platform experts.  
2. Use *live coding sessions* or pair‑programming with remote collaboration tools (Live Share, CodeTogether).  
3. Conduct structured *code reviews* via GitLab merge requests, ensuring reviewers check for architectural compliance, test coverage, and security best practices.  
4. Record review outcomes in a shared knowledge base (Confluence) and tag them with relevant learning tags.  
5. Run *integration demos* on a shared staging environment to validate end‑to‑end flows before merging.  
6. Capture decisions in an *Architecture Decision Record (ADR)* that is automatically linked to the related merge request.

## Challenges
- **Synchronous time zones** – coordinating live sessions across distributed teams.  
- **Decision paralysis** – too many opinions can delay final choices.  
- **Knowledge silos** – preventing critical insights from staying within a single team.  
- **Review fatigue** – excessive code‑review requests leading to missed details.  
- **Tool fragmentation** – using different collaboration tools (Slack, Teams, Jira) that are not fully integrated.

## Interactions
- **Engineering Lead:** final approval of architectural choices and coding standards.  
- **Product Owner:** ensures feature meets business objectives and prioritization is respected.  
- **QA Lead:** validates test coverage and risk assessment during reviews.  
- **Platform Engineer:** verifies infrastructure or platform constraints are considered.  
- **Security Analyst:** checks for security compliance in design and implementation.

## Touchpoints
- ***GitLab Merge Requests* / GitHub Pull Requests*** – code review workflow.  
- ***Confluence* (ADR & decision logs)*** – documentation of choices and rationale.  
- ***Zoom/Teams* (live reviews, pair‑programming sessions)*** – real‑time collaboration.  
- ***Slack* (#dev‑collab channel)*** – quick clarifications and informal feedback loops.  
- ***Jira* (issue linking)* – trace decisions back to user stories or epics.

## Feeling
- 🤝 **Collaborative** – feeling part of a cohesive, cross‑team effort.  
- 🧠 **Informed** – clarity about why certain architectural paths were chosen.  
- 🚀 **Empowered** – having the ability to influence design and quality decisions early.

## Opportunities
1. Automate *review reminder bots* that ping reviewers 24 h before a merge request is ready.  
2. Deploy an AI‑powered *code review assistant* that highlights common anti‑patterns during the review.  
3. Introduce a *decision‑tracking dashboard* that visualizes all ADRs and their current status.  
4. Offer “review rotation” schedules to distribute knowledge across team members evenly.  
5. Build a shared *knowledge hub* that surfaces past collaboration artifacts (recorded demos, decision logs) via semantic search.

## Potential for AI
- **Review Summarizer Bot** – condenses reviewer comments into actionable bullet points automatically.  
- **Decision‑Impact Analyzer** – simulates how an architectural change would affect downstream services and costs.  
- **Knowledge Retrieval Assistant** – answers questions about past decisions by parsing ADRs, chat logs, and documentation.  
- **Collaboration Heatmap** – visualizes who interacts with whom across review cycles to surface hidden bottlenecks.
