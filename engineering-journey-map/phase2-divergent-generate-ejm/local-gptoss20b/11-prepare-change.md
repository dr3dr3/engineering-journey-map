# 11 – Prepare Change

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we ensure every change is documented, reviewed, and approved before it touches production?**  
- **How do we align cross‑functional risk assessments to maintain service reliability?**  
- **How do we automate the creation of change tickets to reduce manual overhead?**  
- **How do we provide visibility into change status for all stakeholders?**  
- **How do we capture lessons learned from each change to feed back into continuous improvement?

## Actions
- Draft and submit a Change Request (CR) or Incident Ticket in the organization’s ticketing system.  
- Perform impact analysis: identify affected services, SLAs, and potential dependencies.  
- Populate risk assessment templates with severity scores and mitigation plans.  
- Coordinate with Release Managers, QA leads, Security, and Ops for review.  
- Obtain approvals from the Change Advisory Board (CAB) or automated approval workflows.  
- Schedule the change window in the release calendar and lock down conflicting deployments.  
- Document rollback procedures and post‑deployment validation steps.

## Challenges
- **Scope creep**: changes often expand beyond initial boundaries during review.  
- **Approval bottlenecks**: multiple stakeholders can delay the process, especially for large releases.  
- **Documentation gaps**: incomplete CRs lead to miscommunication and unforeseen outages.  
- **Risk estimation accuracy**: under‑estimating impact can cause critical incidents post‑deployment.  
- **Tool fragmentation**: disparate systems (Jira, ServiceNow, Confluence) make it hard to keep data in sync.

## Interactions
- **Release Manager:** review timelines & coordinate deployment slots.  
- **Change Advisory Board (CAB):** final approval and governance oversight.  
- **Security Lead:** ensure compliance checks and vulnerability scanning are integrated.  
- **QA Team:** verify test coverage and acceptance criteria for the change.  
- **Operations / SREs:** assess infrastructure impact and rollback readiness.  
- **Product Owner / PM:** confirm business value alignment with release goals.  
- **Support Desk:** update incident templates that might be affected by the change.

## Touchpoints
- **📌 ServiceNow / Jira:** ticket creation, status tracking, SLA enforcement.  
- **📝 Confluence:** documentation of procedures, runbooks, and post‑mortems.  
- **🤝 Slack / Teams (Change Channel):** real‑time notifications and approvals.  
- **🔄 CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions / Jenkins):** automated gatekeeping of change merges.  
- **☁️ Cloud Provider Change Management APIs:** scheduling infra changes in AWS/GCP/Azure.  
- **📈 Monitoring Dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana):** pre‑deployment baseline metrics.  
- **🛠️ Configuration Management Database (CMDB):** inventory of affected assets.

## Feeling
- 😌 **Assured** – when the change request is complete and all approvals are signed off.  
- ⚙️ **Prepared** – knowing rollback plans and impact assessments are in place.  
- 🚨 **Alerted** – if risk scores trigger emergency escalation procedures.  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** – during cross‑team reviews that surface hidden dependencies.  
- 🎯 **Focused** – once the change window is locked and resources are ready.

## Opportunities
1. Automate CR generation from Git commits or feature flags (high impact).  
2. Deploy a unified approval workflow with configurable gate rules to reduce bottlenecks.  
3. Introduce risk‑based routing: high‑risk changes get instant CAB escalation.  
4. Centralize documentation templates in a single source of truth to avoid duplication.  
5. Leverage real‑time telemetry to validate pre‑deployment baselines automatically.  
6. Create an AI‑driven post‑mortem summarizer that extracts root causes from logs.  
7. Integrate change calendars with team availability tools to optimize scheduling.  
8. Implement continuous compliance checks that flag policy violations before approval.

## Potential for AI
- **AI‑Assisted Risk Scoring** – models predict the probability of failure based on code churn and historical incidents.  
- **Natural Language Summarization** – automatically generate concise change briefs from raw ticket text.  
- **Predictive Impact Analysis** – ML algorithms forecast downstream service impact using dependency graphs.  
- **Automated Compliance Checking** – AI scans CRs for missing security or regulatory clauses.  
- **Smart Approval Routing** – recommend the optimal CAB members to review based on expertise and workload.
