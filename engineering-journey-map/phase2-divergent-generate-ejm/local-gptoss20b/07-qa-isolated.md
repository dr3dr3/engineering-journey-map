# QA Isolated

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we validate a single feature or change without interference from other concurrent work?**
- **How can we guarantee that isolated tests reflect the real production behavior?**
- **What metrics and checks ensure reliability before integration into shared pipelines?**

## Actions
1. Spin up an *isolated test namespace* in Kubernetes or a dedicated Docker Compose stack that mirrors the relevant microservice stack.  
2. Execute unit, contract, and integration tests for the new feature in this sandbox environment.  
3. Run *snapshot tests* against a baseline state to detect unintended side‑effects.  
4. Capture logs, metrics, and traces from the isolated run using Loki/Tempo or equivalent.  
5. Store test results in GitLab CI artifacts and attach them to the merge request for review.  
6. Conduct a *dry‑run deployment* of the feature into the isolated namespace to validate Helm/Terraform templates.  
7. Mark the test run as “green” only when coverage > 90 % and all static analysis checks pass.

## Challenges
- **State leakage** – shared caches or databases can bleed data between isolated runs.  
- **Resource contention** – running many isolated environments simultaneously strains CI infrastructure.  
- **Environment drift** – keeping the isolated stack in sync with production (config, secrets) is time‑consuming.  
- **Test flakiness** – intermittent failures due to race conditions or timing issues.  
- **Cost of duplication** – replicating services for isolation can increase cloud spend.

## Interactions
- **QA Lead:** orchestrates the test matrix and approves final pass/fail criteria.  
- **Engineering Lead:** ensures that feature code aligns with architecture before isolation.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** configures the isolated namespace, manages Helm releases, and monitors resource usage.  
- **Platform Engineer:** verifies that infrastructure as code (IaC) matches production templates.  

## Touchpoints
- ***GitLab CI* (job definitions for isolated tests)** – orchestrates pipeline stages.  
- ***Docker Compose / Kubernetes* (isolated namespace or pod)** – runtime environment.  
- ***Helm/Terraform* (IaC artifacts)** – provisioning of services in the sandbox.  
- ***Postman/Newman* (API contract tests)** – verifies endpoint behavior.  
- ***SonarQube* (code coverage & static analysis)** – quality gates.  
- ***Loki/Tempo* (logging & tracing)** – observability during isolation.  
- ***TestRail* / *Zephyr* (test case management)** – traceability of isolated test cases.

## Feeling
- 🔒 **Secure** – confidence that no external factor is skewing results.  
- 🧪 **Controlled** – a clear, reproducible environment for reliable testing.

## Opportunities
1. Automate the creation and teardown of isolated namespaces via GitLab CI templates to reduce manual effort.  
2. Integrate an *IaC drift detector* that flags differences between sandbox and production configurations before tests run.  
3. Deploy an AI‑based *flakiness predictor* that analyzes previous runs to flag potentially unstable tests.  
4. Offer a *cost‑optimization dashboard* that shows resource usage per isolated test, enabling better scheduling.  
5. Provide a *snapshot comparison tool* that visualizes differences in API responses and database states between iterations.

## Potential for AI
- **Test Flakiness Detector** – learns patterns from past failures to warn developers before commit.  
- **Resource Allocation Optimizer** – predicts required CPU/memory for isolated runs, auto‑scales CI runners accordingly.  
- **Intelligent Test Suite Selector** – recommends the minimal subset of tests that cover new changes based on code coverage heatmaps.  
- **Anomaly‑Detection Bot** – monitors logs and metrics in real time to flag unexpected behavior during isolation.  
- **Auto‑Documentation Assistant** – generates test run summaries, including key metrics and any deviations from baseline.
