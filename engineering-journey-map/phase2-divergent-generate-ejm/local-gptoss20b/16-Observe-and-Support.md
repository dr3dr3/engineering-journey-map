# 16. Observe and Support

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we** detect incidents before they impact users?  
- **How do we** rapidly isolate the root cause in a multi‑service environment?  
- **How do we** keep stakeholders informed throughout the resolution cycle?  
- **How do we** balance speed of fix with confidence in stability?  

## Actions
- Monitor alerting systems (PagerDuty, Opsgenie) for incident triggers.  
- Spin up diagnostic dashboards in Grafana or Kibana to visualize affected services.  
- Execute automated runbooks via Ansible or Terraform to apply quick patches.  
- Communicate status updates through Slack channels and incident tickets.  
- Coordinate with developers to deploy hot‑fixes or rollbacks.  
- Document post‑incident findings in a shared knowledge base (Confluence, Notion).  

## Challenges
- Incomplete telemetry leads to blind spots.  
- Alert fatigue from noisy thresholds.  
- Limited context when incidents span multiple teams.  
- Time pressure vs. risk of incomplete remediation.  
- Coordinating across time zones and on‑call schedules.  

## Interactions
- **Incident Response Team:** orchestrate triage and escalation.  
- **SRE / Ops:** provide infrastructure insight and runbook guidance.  
- **Developers:** implement hotfixes or modify code paths.  
- **Product Owner / Stakeholders:** receive status updates and impact assessments.  
- **Security Team:** assess potential security implications of incidents.  
- **Support Desk:** relay customer‑reported issues to the internal team.  
- **Customers (via support portals):** receive outage notifications and ETA.  

## Touchpoints
- **PagerDuty:** alerting & on‑call routing.  
- **Grafana:** live dashboards for metrics visualization.  
- **Prometheus:** time‑series data collection for alerts.  
- **Kibana / Loki:** log aggregation and search.  
- **ServiceNow:** incident ticket lifecycle management.  
- **Slack:** real‑time communication & status channels.  
- **Splunk:** deep log analysis and correlation.  
- **Jira Service Desk:** issue tracking for customer‑facing incidents.  

## Feeling
- ⚡ **Urgent** – the pressure of resolving issues quickly keeps engineers focused.  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** – cross‑team coordination fosters a shared sense of purpose.  
- 🧩 **Insightful** – uncovering root causes provides learning opportunities.  
- 😰 **Anxious** – high stakes can induce stress, especially during outages.  
- 🎯 **Accomplished** – closing an incident successfully yields tangible satisfaction.  

## Opportunities
1. Implement AI‑powered triage bots to surface the most relevant logs and metrics automatically.  
2. Create unified, role‑specific dashboards that reduce time‑to‑diagnosis for SREs vs. developers.  
3. Standardize runbooks with versioned templates stored in a single source of truth.  
4. Reduce alert fatigue by refining thresholds using historical data and anomaly detection.  
5. Automate post‑incident knowledge capture through NLP summarization tools.  
6. Introduce “blameless” post‑mortem workflows to encourage candid learning.  
7. Provide proactive health checks that surface issues before they trigger alerts.  
8. Train cross‑functional teams on incident response best practices to shorten mean time to resolution (MTTR).  

## Potential for AI
- **Incident Triage Bot** – automatically groups related alerts and surfaces the most likely root cause.  
- **Predictive Outage Detector** – learns normal patterns in metrics and predicts imminent failures.  
- **Auto‑Runbook Executor** – runs predefined remediation scripts based on incident classification.  
- **Sentiment‑Aware Alerting** – adjusts alert severity by gauging user impact through support tickets.  
- **Post‑Mortem Summarizer** – uses NLP to condense logs and chat transcripts into concise, actionable reports.
