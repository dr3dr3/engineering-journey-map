# Local Development

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we write high‑quality code that aligns with architectural decisions?**
- **How do we continuously validate functionality through unit and integration tests?**
- **How do we debug effectively while preserving context for future debugging?**

## Actions
1. Checkout the feature branch from GitLab and pull the latest `main` to stay up to date.  
2. Use the IDE (VS Code/JetBrains) with pre‑configured linting, formatting, and language server extensions.  
3. Write *unit tests* that cover core logic before implementation (test‑driven development).  
4. Spin up local services using Docker Compose or Minikube to mimic production dependencies.  
5. Run the test suite locally (`npm test` / `pytest`) after every change to catch regressions early.  
6. Use the built‑in debugger and logging facilities to trace issues in real time.  
7. Commit code following semantic versioning and descriptive messages that reference the Jira issue ID.

## Challenges
- **Environment parity** – local dev settings diverging from staging/production can hide bugs.  
- **Dependency management** – ensuring local libraries match CI pipeline versions.  
- **Debugging complexity** – multi‑service interactions may require orchestrated debugging tools.  
- **Code quality drift** – temptation to skip tests or linting in fast‑moving code paths.  
- **Resource constraints** – local machines may struggle with heavy containerized stacks.

## Interactions
- **Engineering Lead:** review of coding standards and architectural alignment.  
- **QA Engineer (peer):** informal test reviews before pushing to CI.  
- **DevOps Engineer:** guidance on reproducing production‑like environments locally.  

## Touchpoints
- ***GitLab* / GitHub*** – source control, PRs, merge requests.  
- ***VS Code* / IntelliJ*** – IDE with integrated extensions (ESLint, Pylint).  
- ***Docker Compose* / Minikube* – local container orchestration.  
- ***Postman* or *Insomnia* – API testing against local services.  
- ***SonarQube* (local analysis)* – static code quality checks.  

## Feeling
- 🔧 **Productive** – having all tooling wired up reduces friction.  
- ✅ **Confident** – running tests locally provides immediate feedback on correctness.  

## Opportunities
1. Create a *local dev starter kit* that bundles Docker Compose, environment variables, and test data seeds.  
2. Integrate an AI‑powered code review assistant that suggests refactors or lint rule violations in the editor.  
3. Offer “debug‑as‑you‑code” sessions where the IDE automatically captures call stacks for later analysis.  
4. Build a *test coverage heatmap* overlay in the IDE to visualise uncovered code paths.  

## Potential for AI
- **Code Completion & Refactor Bot** – suggests idiomatic patterns and refactoring opportunities.  
- **Automatic Test Stub Generator** – creates minimal test scaffolds based on function signatures.  
- **Debug Insight Assistant** – analyzes logs and stack traces to pinpoint root causes faster.  
- **Environment Sync Checker** – alerts when local Docker images or configurations differ from CI settings.
