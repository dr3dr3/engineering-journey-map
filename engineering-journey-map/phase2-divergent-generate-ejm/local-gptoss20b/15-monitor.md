# 15 – Monitor

## Journey Step Focus
- How do we continuously observe system health and performance?  
- How do we detect anomalies before they impact users?  
- How do we ensure SLAs are met across all services?  
- How do we provide actionable insights to the teams responsible for uptime?

## Actions
1. Collect metrics from all micro‑services (latency, error rates, throughput).  
2. Aggregate logs and trace data into a centralized observability platform.  
3. Configure alert rules that correlate multiple signals (e.g., rising latency + spike in errors).  
4. Run health checks against critical endpoints and external dependencies.  
5. Visualize key performance indicators on dashboards for engineering, ops, and product stakeholders.  
6. Review incident reports and root‑cause analyses weekly to identify trends.  
7. Adjust alert thresholds or add new metrics based on emerging patterns.  
8. Automate remediation actions (auto‑scaling, circuit breakers) when conditions are met.

## Challenges
- Data overload: filtering noise from meaningful signals in large metric volumes.  
- Alert fatigue caused by poorly tuned thresholds or duplicate alerts across teams.  
- Maintaining up‑to‑date dashboards when services evolve rapidly.  
- Coordinating cross‑team ownership of metrics and incident response.  
- Ensuring data privacy while collecting telemetry in regulated environments.

## Interactions
- **Observability Engineer**: designs metric schemas, log parsers, and tracing instrumentation.  
- **Platform Ops Team**: manages underlying monitoring stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger).  
- **Incident Manager**: escalates alerts, coordinates triage, and leads post‑mortems.  
- **Product Owner**: sets SLA targets and business KPIs that feed into dashboards.  
- **Security Lead**: ensures telemetry does not leak sensitive data.  
- **Compliance Officer**: validates that monitoring complies with regulatory requirements.

## Touchpoints
- 📊 Observability Stack (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki) – metric collection, alerting, and log aggregation.  
- 🧩 Distributed Tracing (Jaeger, OpenTelemetry) – end‑to‑end request flow visibility.  
- ⚠️ Alerting System (PagerDuty, Opsgenie) – incident notification and escalation.  
- 📦 Service Mesh (Istio, Linkerd) – injects telemetry into service traffic.  
- 🔍 Log Analyzer (Elastic Stack, Splunk) – deep search of log data for patterns.  
- 🛠️ Auto‑Scaling Policies – triggers scaling actions based on metric thresholds.

## Feeling
- 🎯 **Targeted** – confidence that metrics align with real business goals.  
- ⚡ **Responsive** – quick reaction to emerging performance issues.  
- 🔄 **Iterative** – continuous improvement of monitoring coverage and alert logic.  
- 📈 **Insightful** – data‑driven understanding of system behavior over time.  
- 🤝 **Collaborative** – shared ownership of observability across teams.

## Opportunities
1. Introduce an AI‑based anomaly detector that learns normal patterns and flags deviations automatically.  
2. Build a unified “SLA Dashboard” that aggregates all service level objectives in one place.  
3. Automate auto‑remediation for common incidents (e.g., scale‑up on sustained latency).  
4. Expand metric collection to include customer‑experience signals (RUM, APM).  
5. Implement predictive capacity planning using machine learning on historical load data.  
6. Standardize alert definitions with a shared library to reduce duplication and confusion.  
7. Integrate compliance checks into the monitoring pipeline for regulated services.  
8. Provide self‑service query tools so teams can drill down into telemetry without ops assistance.

## Potential for AI
- **Smart Alerting Engine** – ML adjusts thresholds in real time, reducing false positives while catching true incidents.  
- **Predictive SLA Violation Forecast** – models anticipate when an SLA might be breached and trigger pre‑emptive actions.  
- **Log Summarization Bot** – NLP condenses large log streams into concise incident summaries for faster triage.  
- **Root‑Cause Recommendation System** – correlates metrics, logs, and traces to suggest likely failure points.  
- **Auto‑Remediation Advisor** – recommends or executes scaling, circuit breaker activation, or service restarts based on observed patterns.
