# 17. Assess and Feedback

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we** measure customer satisfaction after a release?  
- **How do we** capture engineering velocity and quality metrics for continuous improvement?  
- **How do we** surface actionable insights from incident data and user feedback?  
- **How do we** ensure alignment between product, ops, and support in post‑release reviews?  

## Actions
- Run NPS or CSAT surveys via email or in‑app prompts.  
- Collect telemetry on feature usage, error rates, and performance KPIs (SLOs).  
- Conduct sprint retrospectives with cross‑functional participants.  
- Compile incident post‑mortems into a centralized knowledge base.  
- Feed insights back into backlog refinement and capacity planning.  
- Track defect density and code coverage trends in CI/CD pipelines.  

## Challenges
- Low survey response rates reduce data representativeness.  
- Fragmented metrics across tools make holistic analysis difficult.  
- Biases in self‑reported satisfaction can skew decisions.  
- Aligning technical KPIs with business outcomes often requires translation work.  
- Ensuring timely feedback loops without overloading teams.  

## Interactions
- **Product Owner:** defines success criteria and interprets customer data.  
- **Engineering Lead / SRE:** shares system health metrics and incident trends.  
- **Support Desk:** provides qualitative customer stories and pain points.  
- **Marketing/Finance:** contextualizes NPS scores against revenue goals.  
- **Customer Success Managers:** act as the voice of the user in cross‑team meetings.  
- **Data Science Team:** builds dashboards and predictive models from operational data.  
- **Executive Stakeholders:** receive high‑level performance summaries.  

## Touchpoints
- **SurveyMonkey / Typeform:** NPS/CSAT collection.  
- **Datadog / New Relic:** system metrics and SLO dashboards.  
- **GitHub Insights / Azure DevOps Analytics:** engineering velocity and commit data.  
- **Jira Service Desk:** incident tickets and resolution times.  
- **Confluence / Notion:** repository for post‑mortem knowledge.  
- **Slack / Teams:** channels for retrospective notes and quick feedback.  
- **Tableau / Power BI:** visual analytics of customer and operational data.  
- **Email Automation (HubSpot, SendGrid):** trigger survey invites based on release events.  

## Feeling
- 📊 **Informed** – data‑driven confidence in product direction.  
- 🤔 **Reflective** – thoughtful analysis of what worked and what didn’t.  
- 🌱 **Growth‑oriented** – eagerness to iterate for better outcomes.  
- 😕 **Uncertain** – navigating conflicting metrics or ambiguous feedback.  
- 🚀 **Motivated** – clear evidence that improvements are making an impact.  

## Opportunities
1. Integrate survey triggers with CI/CD so NPS is collected automatically post‑release.  
2. Build a unified dashboard that correlates user sentiment, error rates, and feature usage.  
3. Automate the extraction of key insights from incident logs using NLP summarization.  
4. Adopt hypothesis‑driven retrospectives to focus on data‑backed improvement actions.  
5. Standardize metrics definitions (SLOs, MTTR, NPS) across teams for consistency.  
6. Use predictive analytics to anticipate feature adoption and potential pain points.  
7. Introduce a “feedback sprint” where all engineering time is dedicated to improving feedback loops.  
8. Create cross‑team ownership of post‑mortem documentation to ensure continuous learning.  

## Potential for AI
- **Sentiment‑Enhanced Survey Analyzer** – auto‑classifies open‑ended responses into themes and sentiment scores.  
- **Anomaly Detection in Release Metrics** – flags unexpected drops in NPS or spikes in error rates immediately after deployment.  
- **Root‑Cause Prediction Engine** – predicts likely root causes of incidents based on historical patterns before human triage.  
- **Feedback Prioritization AI** – ranks user feedback items by impact potential using natural language understanding and metric correlation.  
- **Dynamic Retrospective Coach** – guides teams through data‑driven retrospectives, suggesting discussion prompts based on sprint metrics.
