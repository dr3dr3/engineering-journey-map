# Onboarding

## Journey Step Focus
- **How do we help new engineers quickly understand team culture?**
- **How do we streamline access to essential tools and environments?**
- **How do we onboard technical knowledge about the stack and processes?**
- **How do we set clear expectations for contributions?**
- **How do we foster early ownership and confidence?**

## Actions
1. Provide a digital welcome kit with links to documentation, policies, and tool access instructions.  
2. Schedule a ‚Äúfirst‚Äëday‚Äù virtual coffee with the team lead and a peer mentor.  
3. Run an automated environment provisioning script (IaC) that sets up local dev tools, IDE extensions, and API keys.  
4. Deliver a short sprint planning session to introduce current backlog items and priorities.  
5. Assign a ‚Äústarter ticket‚Äù with clear acceptance criteria for the new engineer to complete in < 24‚ÄØhrs.  
6. Set up regular check‚Äëins (weekly) with the onboarding manager to capture feedback and answer questions.  
7. Provide a quick‚Äëstart guide for CI/CD pipelines, linting rules, and code‚Äëreview expectations.

## Challenges
- **Tool complexity** ‚Äì multiple SaaS platforms with overlapping functionalities.  
- **Knowledge gaps** ‚Äì varying levels of familiarity with our proprietary stack.  
- **Time to productivity** ‚Äì the learning curve can delay first meaningful contribution.  
- **Cultural assimilation** ‚Äì aligning new hires with distributed, remote team norms.  
- **Onboarding fatigue** ‚Äì information overload during the first week.

## Interactions
- **Team Lead:** brief on coding standards and sprint cadence.  
- **Product Manager:** overview of product vision and user stories.  
- **HR:** walk‚Äëthrough of benefits, policies, and compliance requirements.  
- **Security Engineer:** instruction on IAM roles and secure credential handling.  
- **DevOps Architect:** deep dive into CI/CD pipeline structure and deployment targets.  
- **Platform Support:** guidance on using the internal knowledge base and ticketing system.  

## Touchpoints
- ***GitLab*** ‚Äì source‚Äëcontrol, merge requests, issue tracking.  
- ***Confluence*** ‚Äì centralized documentation repository.  
- ***Slack*** ‚Äì real‚Äëtime communication, channel onboarding.  
- ***Jira*** ‚Äì task management and sprint planning.  
- ***CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions)*** ‚Äì automated build, test, and linting.  
- ***Kubernetes Cluster*** ‚Äì container orchestration for local dev.  
- ***Cloud IAM*** ‚Äì role‚Äëbased access to production resources.  
- ***Monitoring Dashboard (Grafana)*** ‚Äì visual insights into system health.

## Feeling
- üòï **Overwhelmed** ‚Äì juggling many new tools and processes.  
- ü§î **Curious** ‚Äì eager to learn the stack and team culture.  
- üõ†Ô∏è **Empowered** ‚Äì confident after setting up a working dev environment.  
- üöÄ **Motivated** ‚Äì excited about first contribution.  

## Opportunities
1. Centralize onboarding scripts into a single ‚Äústarter kit‚Äù repository with version control.  
2. Implement an AI‚Äëpowered chatbot that answers FAQs and guides through setup steps.  
3. Create interactive video walkthroughs for each major platform service.  
4. Offer a micro‚Äëlearning curriculum delivered via the learning management system.  
5. Automate environment teardown after onboarding to reduce resource costs.  
6. Introduce peer‚Äëreview ‚Äúbuddy checks‚Äù to validate configuration and code quality early.  
7. Collect quantitative metrics (time to first PR, issue resolution time) to continuously refine the process.  

## Potential for AI
- **Smart Onboarding Assistant** ‚Äì a conversational agent that walks new hires through tool setup step‚Äëby‚Äëstep.  
- **Code Review AI** ‚Äì automatically checks merge requests against style guides and suggests improvements.  
- **Knowledge Graph Search** ‚Äì semantic search across Confluence, GitLab wikis, and Slack archives to surface relevant information.  
- **Predictive Ramp‚ÄëUp Model** ‚Äì ML model that estimates when a new engineer will hit key productivity milestones based on early activity patterns.  
- **Sentiment Analysis Bot** ‚Äì monitors onboarding chat channels for emotional cues and escalates concerns to the onboarding manager.
