# QA User Acceptance

## Journey Step Focus
* How do we validate that the delivered feature satisfies business expectations?  
* How do we capture stakeholder feedback in a structured, repeatable way?  
* How do we ensure the UAT environment mirrors production while remaining cost‑effective?  
* How do we decide when an issue is critical enough to block release vs. acceptable risk?  
* How do we transition from UAT sign‑off back into continuous delivery pipelines?

## Actions
1. Provision a **UAT sandbox** that duplicates the production stack (K8s/ECS, databases, external services) using IaC and blue‑green deployments.  
2. Import realistic test data via anonymised snapshots or synthetic generators to preserve privacy while reflecting real usage patterns.  
3. Create **test cases in a shared management tool** (Jira Test Management, Azure DevOps Test Plans, Zephyr) that map directly to business requirements.  
4. Run **manual exploratory testing** and guided walkthroughs with representative users from each stakeholder group.  
5. Log defects through the same system, tag them with severity, priority, and impacted user stories.  
6. Facilitate a formal **sign‑off meeting** (virtual or in‑person) where stakeholders review outcomes and approve release readiness.  
7. Capture UAT metrics—test pass rate, defect density, time to resolve—and feed them into the post‑release analytics dashboard.  
8. Once sign‑off is granted, trigger automated promotion of the build to staging/production via CI/CD.

## Challenges
* **Data privacy** – ensuring no sensitive data leaks into the UAT environment while still providing realistic scenarios.  
* **Environment consistency** – keeping the UAT stack identical to production without excessive cost or complexity.  
* **Stakeholder availability** – aligning busy business users for test sessions and sign‑off decisions.  
* **Defect triage ambiguity** – deciding which bugs are blockers vs. acceptable risk in a time‑constrained release window.  
* **Tool integration** – synchronising issue trackers, test management, and CI/CD pipelines to avoid information silos.

## Interactions
* **Product Owner / Business Analyst**: define acceptance criteria and validate business outcomes.  
* **UX Lead**: review interface usability and gather user feedback during walkthroughs.  
* **Platform Engineers**: maintain the UAT environment, ensuring networking, scaling, and monitoring match production.  
* **QA Lead**: orchestrate test planning, defect triage, and sign‑off ceremonies.  
* **Release Manager**: coordinate promotion of builds post‑sign‑off.

## Touchpoints
* ***Jira / Azure DevOps*** – track requirements, test cases, defects, and status.  
* ***Test Management Tool (Zephyr/TestRail)*** – manage UAT test runs and results.  
* ***CI/CD Pipeline (GitHub Actions/GitLab CI)*** – trigger environment deployment and build promotion.  
* ***Kubernetes / ECS** - host the isolated UAT cluster.  
* ***Prometheus & Grafana** – monitor system health during user acceptance testing.  
* ***Slack / Teams** – communicate test progress, blockers, and release readiness.  
* ***Data Masking Tool (e.g., Deid)*** – anonymise production data before importing into UAT.

## Feeling
* 😊 **Reassured** – when all key business use‑cases pass and stakeholders feel the product meets expectations.  
* 😟 **Apprehensive** – if critical defects surface late in the cycle or stakeholder alignment stalls.  
* 🤝 **Collaborative** – when cross‑functional teams work together to resolve issues swiftly.  
* 🚀 **Excited** – after a smooth sign‑off, knowing the release is ready for production.

## Opportunities
1. **Automate UAT test data provisioning** with synthetic data generators to speed up environment setup.  
2. **Implement a lightweight UAT orchestration layer** (e.g., Harness, Spinnaker) to manage blue‑green releases and rollback automatically if sign‑off fails.  
3. **Leverage user behavior analytics** to prioritize high‑impact test scenarios based on actual usage patterns.  
4. **Integrate defect triage bots** that auto‑classify bugs into severity buckets using NLP on issue descriptions.  
5. **Use collaborative testing platforms (e.g., Testim, Applitools) for visual regression checks** in UAT.  
6. **Create a feedback loop dashboard** that aggregates UAT metrics and feeds them back into product backlog refinement.  
7. **Introduce automated sign‑off triggers**: once all tests pass and defect threshold is met, automatically notify stakeholders to review.  
8. **Offer self‑service UAT portals** where business users can run approved test scripts on demand, reducing QA bottlenecks.

## Potential for AI
* **AI‑powered test case generation** – generate acceptance scenarios from user stories and requirement documents automatically.  
* **Predictive defect detection** – machine learning models flag potential high‑severity bugs before UAT runs begin.  
* **Sentiment analysis on stakeholder feedback** – NLP extracts pain points from meeting transcripts or chat logs to surface recurring issues early.  
* **Automated test data synthesis** – generative AI creates realistic, privacy‑preserving datasets tailored to specific business scenarios.  
* **Intelligent triage assistant** – AI prioritises defects based on impact, frequency, and historical resolution times.
