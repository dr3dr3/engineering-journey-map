## Executive Summary

This adoption plan maps specific activities to the Jobs-to-be-Done timeline phases, addressing how engineers progress from first recognizing technical debt problems to successfully integrating systematic debt management into their daily workflows. The plan acknowledges that adoption is not just about implementing tools, but about helping engineers navigate the emotional and practical journey of changing how they balance quality and delivery commitments.

### Key Timeline Insights for Technical Debt Management
- **Extended evaluation period**: Engineers need substantial proof that debt management won't compromise delivery
- **Peer validation crucial**: Success stories from similar engineering contexts drive adoption
- **Incremental commitment**: Engineers prefer gradual adoption rather than wholesale process changes
- **Cultural alignment**: Adoption requires organizational support for quality investment
