## Phase #2 - Generating Engineering Journey Maps

#file:MISSION-EJM.md Referring to this file, create an engineering journey map with a markdown file for each journey step and using the prescribed structure. Think hard. Do research and use sources relating to IT Engineering, DevOps, and Platform Engineering best practices. Create these files in a new sub-folder called "x"

## Phase #3 - Refining the Engineering Journey Map

Create a step for **continuous improvement (step #20)** as part of an engineering journey map as per the instruction in #file:MISSION.md. Create this in a new sub-folder called "refined-journey-map" under the existing folder "phase3-convergent-refine-ejm". Follow the same structure and style as the existing markdown files in that folder. Limit each section to only 3 bullet points, this overrides the instructions in MISSION.md. Use the existing onboarding file in the engineering journey maps documented in the folder "phase2-divergent-generate-ejm". Use the files under the "clues" folder for added context of what matters for our specific scenario. Look at the journey map documented in the folder "journey-map-votes" and use the votes to prioritize what is to be included in the new journey map. The votes are in the brackets at the end of the bullet points. The higher the votes the more important it is. Add star rating under the main heading as based on the ratings in #file:priorities.md. Think deeply. Ultrathink.
