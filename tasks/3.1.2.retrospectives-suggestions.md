# Task 3.1.2: Create Retrospective Suggestions

## Task Overview

Create actionable retrospective suggestions to gather engineering team feedback on the Engineering Journey Map, specifically identifying pain points, friction areas, platform engineering improvement opportunities, and priorities for the platform engineering team.

## Context

This task is part of Phase 3: Collect Feedback and Refine. The retrospectives will complement the developer experience surveys by providing deeper, qualitative insights through team discussions. The feedback will be used to refine the Engineering Journey Map created in Phase 2.

## Required Inputs

- Generated Engineering Journey Map from Phase 2 (`phase2-divergent-generate-ejm/generated-journey-map/`)
- Journey Map summary (`phase2-divergent-generate-ejm/summary-of-engineering-journey-map.md`)
- Context guides about retrospectives and journey mapping

## Expected Outputs

Create comprehensive retrospective guidance file: `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/generated/retrospectives-suggestions.md`

## Detailed Requirements

### 1. Retrospective Formats and Structures

Provide multiple retrospective format options that teams can choose based on their preferences and time constraints:

- **Journey-Focused Retrospective:** Deep dive into specific journey map steps
- **Pain Point Retrospective:** Focus on identifying and prioritizing friction areas
- **Platform Services Retrospective:** Evaluate current platform services and identify gaps
- **Time-boxed Options:** 30-minute, 60-minute, and 90-minute formats

### 2. Specific Questions for Each Journey Map Area

Create targeted questions for each of the 20 journey map steps that help identify:
- Current pain points and friction
- Workarounds teams are using
- Time wasted on manual or inefficient processes
- Tools and platform services that could help
- Priority areas for platform engineering investment

### 3. Facilitation Guidance

Provide clear guidance for retrospective facilitators including:
- Pre-retrospective preparation steps
- Techniques for encouraging participation
- Methods for capturing insights effectively
- How to prioritize feedback and identify quick wins
- Strategies for managing time and keeping discussions focused

### 4. Output Documentation Templates

Create templates for capturing and organizing retrospective outputs:
- Pain point documentation format
- Opportunity prioritization matrix
- Action item tracking template
- Feedback summary format that feeds into journey map refinement

## Success Criteria

The retrospective suggestions should:
- ✅ Provide practical, actionable guidance that engineering teams can immediately use
- ✅ Focus specifically on gathering Engineering Journey Map feedback
- ✅ Include questions that surface platform engineering opportunities
- ✅ Offer flexible formats to accommodate different team preferences
- ✅ Generate structured outputs that can be used to refine the journey map
- ✅ Help identify and prioritize platform engineering investment areas

## File Location

Create the file at: `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/retrospectives-suggestions.md`

## Dependencies

This task builds on:
- Completed Engineering Journey Map generation (Phase 2)
- Understanding of platform engineering value proposition (Phase 1)
- Knowledge of journey mapping principles

## Next Steps

After completion, this content will be used by human facilitators in Task 3.2.2 to conduct retrospectives with engineering teams, providing feedback that will inform journey map refinement in Tasks 3.5.1 and 3.5.2.
