Define your desired future state using the AI-generated templates:
- Vision for improved developer experience
- Target technology and tooling
- Desired processes and workflows
- Success metrics and goals
- Resource requirements and constraints

**Deliverable:** Create relevant files in `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/future-state/` folder

### Task 3.4.1: Collect Journey Map Feedback
**Timing:** Ongoing during Phase 3

Gather specific feedback on the journey map:
- Survey results analysis
- Retrospective insights
- Stakeholder interviews
- Direct engineer feedback

**Deliverable:** Save results in `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/survey-results/`

### Task 3.4.2: Capture Retrospective Insights
**Timing:** After task 3.1.4

Summarize retrospective findings:
- Common pain points across teams
- Improvement suggestions
- Priority areas for platform investment
- Team-specific vs universal challenges

**Deliverable:** Update `retrospectives.md` in `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/feedback/`
