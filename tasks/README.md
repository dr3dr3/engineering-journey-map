# Tasks Folder

This folder contains detailed task instructions and tracking for the Engineering Journey Map project.

## Files Overview

### Core Task Files
- **[ai-tasks.md](./ai-tasks.md)** - Comprehensive instructions for AI assistants
- **[human-tasks.md](./human-tasks.md)** - Tasks requiring human input, review, and decision-making
- **[task-tracker.md](./task-tracker.md)** - Progress tracking for all project tasks

## File Purpose

### ai-tasks.md
Contains detailed, step-by-step instructions for AI assistants including:
- Specific file names and folder locations
- Content requirements and structure guidelines
- Context files to reference from previous phases
- Quality criteria and consistency requirements

### human-tasks.md  
Outlines tasks that require human judgment including:
- Review and customization of AI-generated content
- Data collection activities (surveys, retrospectives)
- Stakeholder engagement and decision-making
- Final approval and sign-off processes

### task-tracker.md
Provides visibility into project progress with:
- Task completion status tracking
- Dependencies between tasks
- Progress summary and metrics
- Next action identification

## How to Use These Files

### For AI Assistants
1. Start with the main `PLAN.md` to understand current progress
2. Reference `ai-tasks.md` for detailed task instructions
3. Follow folder structure and naming conventions exactly
4. Use context from previous phases as specified
5. Update `task-tracker.md` when tasks are completed

### For Humans
1. Check `task-tracker.md` for current project status
2. Use `human-tasks.md` to understand your responsibilities
3. Complete human tasks after AI dependencies are met
4. Update progress tracking as work is completed

### For Project Management
1. Use `task-tracker.md` for status reporting
2. Monitor dependencies between AI and human tasks
3. Ensure proper sequencing of work across phases
4. Track overall project completion percentage

## Integration with Main Plan

The main `PLAN.md` file provides a high-level overview while these detailed task files ensure:
- Clear instructions for execution
- Proper sequencing and dependencies
- Quality standards and consistency
- Progress visibility and tracking

This structure optimizes the main plan for AI context windows while providing comprehensive guidance in dedicated task files.
