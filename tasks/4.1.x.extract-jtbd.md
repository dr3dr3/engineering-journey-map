# 4.1.x. Extract Jobs-to-be-Done from the Engineering Journey Map

**Context:** `context-guides/jobs-to-be-done/`

Create markdown files in `engineering-journey-map/phase4-divergent-generate-jtbd/generated/`

For the Engineering Journey Map step specified:
- Review the existing content in the documented Engineering Journey Map step from `phase3-convergent-refine-ejm/refined-journey-map/`
- Identify the key Jobs-to-be-Done from the Engineering Journey Map step
- These are the jobs-to-be-done by the Engineers (not the Platform team)
- Only identify between 1 to 3 jobs-to-be-done
- Comprehensively describe each job-to-be-done
- Create a separate markdown file for each job-to-be-done
- Think deeply
- Use the file naming convention: step-title.md (step = the Engineering Journey Map step, title = title of the job-to-be-done)
- Be consistent in structure and style with the jobs-to-bedone already created (if created)
