# Engineering Journey Map

A structured approach for Platform Engineering teams to apply product management practices in defining and delivering Platform-as-a-Product.

## What is this project?

This project provides a complete framework for creating an **Engineering Journey Map** - a comprehensive view of how software and quality engineers experience their entire development lifecycle, from onboarding through continuous improvement.

The journey map helps platform teams:
- 🎯 **Understand** the current engineer experience across 20 key journey steps
- 🔍 **Identify** pain points, challenges, and opportunities for improvement  
- 📋 **Prioritize** platform investments using Jobs-to-be-Done methodology
- 🛣️ **Plan** implementation roadmaps that maximize developer productivity

## The 5-Phase Process

This project follows a structured **Double Diamond** approach with alternating divergent (generate) and convergent (refine) phases:

### Phase 1: Mission and Structure 🎯
**Establish the foundation**
- Define platform engineering value proposition and product manager role
- Create journey map structure with 20 standardized steps
- Build shared understanding of why journey mapping matters

### Phase 2: Generate Journey Map 🌟
**Create the initial journey map**
- Generate detailed journey steps covering the full engineering experience
- Document focus areas, actions, challenges, touchpoints, feelings, and opportunities
- Identify potential AI/automation improvements for each step

### Phase 3: Collect Feedback and Refine 🔄
**Validate and improve with real data**
- Deploy surveys and retrospectives to gather engineer feedback
- Document current state pain points and future state vision
- Refine journey map based on actual user experiences

### Phase 4: Jobs to be Done 📝
**Extract actionable insights**
- Convert journey map insights into prioritized Jobs-to-be-Done
- Create priority matrix to focus on highest-impact opportunities
- Align stakeholders on platform investment priorities

### Phase 5: Implementation Roadmap 🚀
**Build actionable plans**
- Create adoption plans for voluntary platform service usage
- Develop detailed implementation plans with timelines and success metrics
- Communicate strategy using "Say it in Six" framework

## Getting Started

### For AI Assistants
1. Review the [Copilot Instructions](/.github/copilot-instructions.md) for project context
2. Check current progress in [PLAN.md](./PLAN.md)
3. Follow detailed task instructions in [tasks/ai-tasks.md](./tasks/ai-tasks.md)
4. Use [context guides](./context-guides/) for background information

### For Platform Teams
1. Start with Phase 1 to establish your mission and customize the journey steps
2. Generate your initial journey map in Phase 2
3. Collect feedback from your engineering teams in Phase 3
4. Extract and prioritize improvement opportunities in Phase 4
5. Build your implementation roadmap in Phase 5
