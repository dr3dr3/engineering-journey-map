# 01. Onboarding

**Objective:** Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively  
**Duration:** 1-2 weeks  
**Frequency:** Once per engineer (with occasional re-onboarding for role changes)

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Gain access to all necessary systems and tools within the first few days
- Understand team workflows, coding standards, and contribution processes
- Successfully complete first meaningful code contribution or bug fix
- Build relationships with team members and identify key contacts for different areas

### Actions
1. Complete HR and legal onboarding requirements and security training
2. Request and receive hardware, accounts, and system access permissions
3. Install and configure development tools, IDEs, and local environment
4. Read team documentation, architecture guides, and coding standards
5. Shadow team members during meetings, code reviews, and daily standups
6. Set up development environment and successfully run existing projects locally
7. Complete first assigned task (usually a small bug fix or documentation update)
8. Participate in knowledge transfer sessions and ask clarifying questions

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Identity management systems, developer portal, documentation sites, code repositories
- **Tools & Systems:** Laptop provisioning, VPN access, development IDEs, containerization platforms, CI/CD systems
- **People & Teams:** HR representatives, IT support, team leads, assigned mentors, security teams

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Successfully running first application locally, helpful mentor interactions, clear documentation
- **Frustration Points:** Waiting for account approvals, complex environment setup, information overload, unclear next steps
- **Confidence Factors:** Quick wins with simple tasks, responsive support when blocked, well-organized onboarding checklist

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Access Delays:** Waiting days for system access while manual approval processes complete, blocking all productive work
- **Environment Complexity:** Spending 2-3 days configuring local development environment with unclear or outdated setup instructions
- **Information Overload:** Receiving too much documentation at once without clear prioritization or learning path guidance
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Needing separate accounts and access requests for 10+ different systems with inconsistent authentication
- **Knowledge Gaps:** Missing context about system architecture, business domain, and team-specific practices not covered in documentation

### Workarounds
- **Buddy System:** Pairing new hires with experienced team members who can share accounts temporarily and provide verbal knowledge transfer
- **Documentation Shortcuts:** Creating personal setup scripts and notes that bypass official but outdated onboarding procedures
- **Shadow Access:** Using shared credentials or over-the-shoulder access to systems while waiting for individual account provisioning

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 40-80 hours over 1-2 weeks, with significant waiting time for external dependencies
- **Skill Requirements:** Basic command line usage, git familiarity, ability to follow technical documentation
- **Cognitive Load:** High context switching between administrative tasks, tool learning, and domain knowledge acquisition

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Self-Service Account Provisioning:** Automated account creation across all development systems triggered by HR onboarding
- **Environment Setup Automation:** One-click development environment provisioning using containers or infrastructure-as-code
- **Onboarding Workflow Orchestration:** Automated checklist progression with notifications and dependency tracking

### Tooling Improvements
- **Developer Portal Integration:** Single sign-on access to all development tools through centralized developer portal
- **Environment Templates:** Pre-configured development environment templates for different roles and tech stacks
- **Onboarding Dashboard:** Progress tracking with clear next steps, blockers, and estimated completion times

### Process Optimization
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Staged information delivery that introduces concepts and tools as they become relevant
- **Role-Based Onboarding:** Customized onboarding paths for different engineering personas (frontend, backend, mobile, data)
- **Feedback Loops:** Systematic collection of onboarding feedback to continuously improve the process

### Knowledge & Support
- **Interactive Documentation:** Hands-on tutorials that combine learning with actual environment setup
- **Video Walkthroughs:** Recorded setup demonstrations for complex configuration tasks
- **Mentorship Matching:** Automated pairing of new hires with mentors based on role, tech stack, and availability

## Success Metrics

### Current State Metrics
- **Time to First Commit:** 8-12 days on average for first meaningful code contribution
- **Setup Completion Rate:** 60% of new hires complete environment setup within first week
- **Support Ticket Volume:** 15-20 tickets per new hire during first month

### Target Metrics
- **Time to First Commit:** 3-5 days for first meaningful code contribution
- **Self-Service Success Rate:** 90% of new hires complete setup without requiring support tickets
- **Onboarding Satisfaction Score:** 4.5/5 average rating on post-onboarding survey

### Platform Impact Metrics
- **Automation Adoption:** 95% of new hires use automated provisioning and setup tools
- **Documentation Usage:** 80% of onboarding tasks completed through self-service resources
- **Support Reduction:** 75% reduction in IT and platform support requests during onboarding period
