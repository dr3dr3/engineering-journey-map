# 04. QA Pre-Development

**Objective:** Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts  
**Duration:** 1-2 days per feature  
**Frequency:** Once per feature or story before development begins

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Define comprehensive testing strategies that ensure quality without blocking development velocity
- Create detailed test cases that cover functional requirements, edge cases, and integration scenarios
- Establish test environments and data that support both manual and automated testing approaches
- Identify quality gates and acceptance criteria that align with business requirements and technical standards
- Coordinate testing responsibilities across development, QA, and platform teams to avoid gaps and duplication

### Actions
1. Analyze functional and non-functional requirements to identify testing scope and complexity
2. Design test strategy including unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing approaches
3. Create detailed test cases with clear steps, expected results, and failure criteria
4. Plan test data requirements including setup, maintenance, and privacy considerations
5. Reserve or provision test environments with appropriate configurations and dependencies
6. Define quality gates and completion criteria for each testing phase
7. Coordinate with QA specialists and platform teams on testing infrastructure needs
8. Document testing timeline and resource requirements within development sprint planning

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Test management platforms, environment provisioning systems, test data management tools, quality gate automation
- **Tools & Systems:** TestRail, Xray, Azure Test Plans, test environment orchestration, CI/CD pipeline configuration
- **People & Teams:** QA engineers, test automation specialists, platform teams, business analysts, product owners

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Clear requirements enabling thorough test planning, available test environments, collaborative QA support
- **Frustration Points:** Unclear acceptance criteria, test environment unavailability, manual test environment setup, conflicting testing tools
- **Confidence Factors:** Well-defined testing standards, automated test infrastructure, dedicated QA partnership

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Environment Provisioning Delays:** Manual test environment setup taking hours or days, blocking testing timeline and sprint commitments
- **Test Data Management:** Lack of realistic test data or privacy-compliant data generation causing incomplete testing coverage
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Multiple disconnected testing tools requiring manual coordination and status synchronization across teams
- **Requirements Ambiguity:** Vague acceptance criteria leading to inadequate test coverage and failed quality gates later in development
- **Resource Conflicts:** Shared test environments causing conflicts between teams and unreliable testing conditions

### Workarounds
- **Personal Test Environments:** Engineers creating ad-hoc local testing setups to avoid shared environment conflicts
- **Production Data Sampling:** Using anonymized production data snapshots for testing despite privacy and compliance risks
- **Manual Test Coordination:** Spreadsheets and email chains to coordinate test environment usage across multiple teams

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 8-16 hours per feature, with significant variability based on complexity and environment availability
- **Skill Requirements:** Understanding of testing methodologies, test automation frameworks, and quality engineering practices
- **Cognitive Load:** High complexity balancing comprehensive coverage with development timeline constraints and resource limitations

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Environment Provisioning:** Automated test environment creation and teardown with infrastructure-as-code and containerization
- **Test Data Generation:** Automated creation of realistic, privacy-compliant test data based on production schemas and patterns
- **Test Case Generation:** AI-assisted test case creation from requirements and user stories with coverage analysis

### Tooling Improvements
- **Integrated Test Planning:** Unified platform connecting requirements, test cases, environment provisioning, and execution tracking
- **Self-Service Test Environments:** Developer-accessible environment provisioning with preset configurations and automatic cleanup
- **Test Environment Catalog:** Searchable inventory of available test environments with real-time status and reservation systems

### Process Optimization
- **Quality Gate Templates:** Pre-configured quality criteria and testing checklists based on feature type and complexity
- **Automated Test Planning:** Integration between story estimation and test effort planning with resource allocation
- **Environment Lifecycle Management:** Automated provisioning, monitoring, and decommissioning of test environments

### Knowledge & Support
- **Testing Strategy Guides:** Context-specific testing guidance based on feature type, technology stack, and risk assessment
- **Test Case Libraries:** Reusable test case templates and patterns for common functionality and integration scenarios
- **Quality Engineering Mentorship:** Embedded QA expertise within development teams through platform engineering support
