# 15. Monitor

**Objective:** Tracking system health metrics, alerts, and SLAs to maintain production service reliability
**Duration:** Continuous
**Frequency:** Ongoing operational activity parallel to development cycles

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Maintain continuous visibility into production system health and performance to ensure reliable service delivery to customers and stakeholders
- Monitor key performance indicators, service level agreements, and system metrics to proactively identify trends and potential issues before they impact users
- Track application and infrastructure performance metrics including response times, error rates, throughput, and resource utilization across all production systems
- Establish and maintain effective alerting thresholds that provide early warning of system degradation while minimizing false positive notifications
- Ensure comprehensive monitoring coverage across all critical system components including databases, APIs, microservices, and infrastructure layers
- Coordinate with operations and platform teams to maintain monitoring infrastructure and improve observability capabilities across the engineering organization

### Actions
1. Configure and maintain comprehensive monitoring dashboards that provide real-time visibility into system health, performance metrics, and business-critical indicators
2. Establish and tune alert thresholds for key performance indicators including error rates, response times, throughput, and resource utilization metrics
3. Monitor service level agreement compliance and track performance against established targets for availability, reliability, and customer experience metrics
4. Perform regular analysis of monitoring data to identify performance trends, capacity requirements, and potential optimization opportunities
5. Investigate monitoring alerts and system anomalies to determine root causes and coordinate appropriate response actions with relevant teams
6. Maintain and update monitoring configurations as system architecture evolves including new services, dependencies, and infrastructure components
7. Review and optimize monitoring costs, performance impact, and data retention policies to ensure efficient and sustainable observability practices
8. Coordinate with development teams to implement application-level monitoring including custom metrics, distributed tracing, and business intelligence indicators
9. Participate in capacity planning activities using historical monitoring data to predict future resource requirements and scaling needs
