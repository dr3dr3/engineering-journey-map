# 02. Planning Work

**Objective:** Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints  
**Duration:** 1-3 days per sprint cycle  
**Frequency:** Every 1-2 weeks per sprint planning cycle

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Break down features and requirements into clear, actionable development tasks
- Provide accurate effort estimates for development work to enable realistic sprint planning
- Understand business context and acceptance criteria for all assigned work
- Align with team on priorities, dependencies, and delivery timelines

### Actions
1. Review product requirements and user stories from product managers and stakeholders
2. Participate in backlog grooming sessions to clarify requirements and acceptance criteria
3. Break down large features into smaller, manageable development tasks and subtasks
4. Estimate effort for development tasks using team estimation techniques (story points, t-shirt sizing)
5. Identify technical dependencies, risks, and potential blockers for upcoming work
6. Commit to sprint goals and deliverables during sprint planning meetings
7. Update task status and progress in project management tools throughout the sprint
8. Participate in cross-team coordination meetings for dependencies and integration points

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Project management systems, requirements documentation platforms, estimation tools, workflow automation
- **Tools & Systems:** Jira, Azure DevOps, Confluence, Slack, planning poker tools, roadmap visualization
- **People & Teams:** Product managers, scrum masters, fellow engineers, QA teams, architecture reviewers

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Clear requirements that are easy to estimate, collaborative planning sessions, realistic sprint commitments
- **Frustration Points:** Vague or changing requirements, pressure to underestimate, over-committed sprints, unclear priorities
- **Confidence Factors:** Well-defined acceptance criteria, team alignment on approach, manageable scope and timeline

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Requirement Ambiguity:** Spending 30-40% of planning time clarifying vague requirements and missing acceptance criteria
- **Estimation Pressure:** Feeling pressured to provide optimistic estimates without sufficient time for technical analysis
- **Tool Fragmentation:** Switching between 4-5 different tools to gather requirements, track dependencies, and update progress
- **Scope Creep:** Mid-sprint requirement changes that invalidate original estimates and planning decisions
- **Dependency Confusion:** Difficulty tracking and coordinating dependencies across multiple teams and services

### Workarounds
- **Over-Estimation Buffer:** Adding hidden buffers to estimates to account for requirement clarification and scope changes
- **Informal Coordination:** Using private Slack channels and hallway conversations to coordinate work instead of formal processes
- **Personal Planning Tools:** Maintaining individual spreadsheets or notes to track actual progress versus official project management tools

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 4-8 hours per sprint for planning activities, plus ongoing updates and coordination
- **Skill Requirements:** Business analysis skills, estimation techniques, understanding of technical architecture and dependencies
- **Cognitive Load:** High mental switching between business requirements, technical constraints, and team coordination

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Requirement Template Automation:** Auto-generating story templates with required fields and acceptance criteria prompts
- **Dependency Detection:** Automated analysis of code repositories to identify potential technical dependencies between stories
- **Estimation Historical Data:** AI-powered estimation suggestions based on similar historical tasks and actual completion times

### Tooling Improvements
- **Unified Planning Dashboard:** Single interface that aggregates requirements, dependencies, estimates, and progress across all tools
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Live planning sessions with integrated video, estimation tools, and shared documentation
- **Smart Task Breakdown:** AI-assisted feature decomposition with suggestions for logical task boundaries and sizing

### Process Optimization
- **Progressive Requirement Refinement:** Structured process for evolving requirements clarity as stories move through the backlog
- **Cross-Team Dependency Management:** Automated tracking and notification system for inter-team dependencies and blockers
- **Estimation Calibration:** Regular retrospective analysis of estimation accuracy with feedback loops for improvement

### Knowledge & Support
- **Requirement Quality Checklist:** Interactive guides for ensuring stories meet "definition of ready" before planning
- **Estimation Training:** Built-in training modules and reference materials for consistent estimation approaches
- **Domain Context Library:** Searchable repository of business domain knowledge and technical context for better planning

## Success Metrics

### Current State Metrics
- **Planning Efficiency:** 25% of sprint time spent on planning and coordination activities
- **Estimation Accuracy:** 40% variance between estimated and actual completion time for stories
- **Requirement Clarification:** Average 3-4 back-and-forth exchanges needed per story to reach clarity

### Target Metrics
- **Planning Efficiency:** 15% of sprint time spent on planning activities with higher quality outcomes
- **Estimation Accuracy:** 20% variance between estimated and actual completion time for stories
- **First-Time Clarity Rate:** 80% of stories reach "definition of ready" without requiring clarification cycles

### Platform Impact Metrics
- **Tool Integration Usage:** 90% of planning activities conducted through integrated platform tools
- **Automated Insights Adoption:** 70% of estimation decisions informed by historical data and AI suggestions
- **Cross-Team Coordination:** 50% reduction in coordination overhead for dependencies and integration planning
