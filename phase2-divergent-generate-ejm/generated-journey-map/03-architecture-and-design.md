# 03. Architecture and Design

**Objective:** Creating solution architectures, technical specifications, and design patterns before development begins  
**Duration:** 2-5 days per feature  
**Frequency:** Once per significant feature or system component

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Design scalable and maintainable technical solutions that meet functional and non-functional requirements
- Create clear technical specifications that guide development and enable code reviews
- Identify and mitigate technical risks before development investment begins
- Establish patterns and standards that can be reused across similar features and components
- Ensure alignment with existing system architecture and technology stack decisions

### Actions
1. Analyze functional requirements and translate them into technical design constraints
2. Research existing patterns, libraries, and architectural precedents within the organization
3. Create high-level system diagrams showing component interactions and data flows
4. Document detailed technical specifications including APIs, data models, and integration points
5. Design database schemas, service interfaces, and communication protocols
6. Participate in architecture review sessions with senior engineers and architects
7. Iterate on design based on feedback, constraints, and technical feasibility analysis
8. Document design decisions, trade-offs, and rationale for future reference

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Architecture documentation platforms, diagramming tools, design pattern libraries, API specification tools
- **Tools & Systems:** Confluence, Miro, Lucidchart, OpenAPI/Swagger, architecture decision record (ADR) systems
- **People & Teams:** Senior engineers, system architects, platform teams, security teams, database administrators

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Clear requirements enabling good design, helpful precedents and patterns, collaborative design sessions
- **Frustration Points:** Conflicting requirements, lack of architectural guidance, pressure to skip design phase, outdated documentation
- **Confidence Factors:** Access to architectural expertise, well-documented system context, time allocated for proper design

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Documentation Fragmentation:** Architecture information scattered across wikis, slide decks, and tribal knowledge making it hard to understand current state
- **Pattern Inconsistency:** Lack of established design patterns leading to custom solutions for common problems and technical debt accumulation
- **Review Bottlenecks:** Senior architect availability limiting design review capacity, causing delays in feature development timelines
- **Requirements Translation:** Difficulty bridging gap between business requirements and technical implementation without domain expertise
- **Tool Limitations:** Using general-purpose tools not optimized for technical architecture work, requiring manual effort for diagram maintenance

### Workarounds
- **Informal Design Sessions:** Whiteboard sessions and hallway conversations replacing formal design review processes
- **Copy-Paste Architecture:** Duplicating existing component designs without proper abstraction or pattern recognition
- **Documentation Shortcuts:** Creating minimal design documentation to meet process requirements without comprehensive analysis

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 16-40 hours per significant feature, with high variability based on complexity and review cycles
- **Skill Requirements:** System design expertise, understanding of architectural patterns, knowledge of organizational technology stack
- **Cognitive Load:** High complexity analyzing requirements, constraints, and trade-offs while maintaining system coherence

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Design Pattern Detection:** Automated analysis of existing codebases to identify and catalog reusable architectural patterns
- **Specification Generation:** Auto-generation of API specifications and interface contracts from design documents
- **Compliance Validation:** Automated checking of designs against organizational architectural principles and security requirements

### Tooling Improvements
- **Architecture Workbench:** Integrated environment combining diagramming, specification writing, and pattern library access
- **Live Documentation:** Documentation that stays synchronized with actual system implementation through code analysis
- **Design Template Library:** Pre-built templates for common architectural patterns with customization guidance

### Process Optimization
- **Asynchronous Design Reviews:** Structured review processes that don't require real-time architect availability
- **Incremental Design Approval:** Breaking large designs into smaller reviewable components for faster feedback cycles
- **Pattern-Based Design:** Streamlined approval for designs that follow established organizational patterns

### Knowledge & Support
- **Architecture Decision Records:** Centralized repository of past design decisions with searchable context and rationale
- **Interactive Design Guidelines:** Guided workflows that help engineers make architecture decisions aligned with organizational standards
- **Design Mentorship Programs:** Structured programs pairing junior engineers with architecture experts for design guidance

## Success Metrics

### Current State Metrics
- **Design Review Cycle Time:** 5-10 days average time from design submission to approval
- **Design Rework Rate:** 30% of designs require significant rework after initial review
- **Pattern Reuse:** 20% of new designs leverage existing organizational patterns

### Target Metrics
- **Design Review Cycle Time:** 2-3 days average time from design submission to approval
- **Design Quality Score:** 90% of designs approved without requiring major rework
- **Pattern Adoption Rate:** 70% of new designs built on established organizational patterns

### Platform Impact Metrics
- **Self-Service Design Success:** 60% of standard designs approved without requiring architect review
- **Documentation Currency:** 95% of architecture documentation reflects actual system implementation
- **Design Tool Adoption:** 85% of design work conducted using integrated platform tooling
