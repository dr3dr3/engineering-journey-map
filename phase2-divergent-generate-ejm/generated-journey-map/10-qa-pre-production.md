# 10. QA Pre-Production

**Objective:** Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions  
**Duration:** 1-3 days per release  
**Frequency:** Once per release cycle when all features have passed user acceptance testing and are ready for production deployment

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Execute comprehensive validation in production-identical environments to ensure features perform correctly under realistic production conditions
- Verify system performance, scalability, and reliability characteristics meet production requirements under expected and peak load scenarios
- Validate security configurations, compliance requirements, and operational readiness before exposing features to production users
- Confirm deployment processes, rollback procedures, and operational runbooks work correctly in production-like environments
- Identify any remaining issues that could impact production stability, performance, or user experience before go-live
- Obtain final technical and operational sign-off confirming readiness for production deployment and customer exposure

### Actions
1. Deploy features to pre-production environment that mirrors production infrastructure, data volumes, and operational configurations
2. Execute comprehensive performance testing including load testing, stress testing, and endurance testing under realistic traffic patterns
3. Validate security configurations including authentication systems, authorization controls, data encryption, and vulnerability scanning
4. Test operational procedures including monitoring setup, alerting configurations, backup and recovery processes, and maintenance workflows
5. Perform disaster recovery testing including failover scenarios, data backup validation, and system restoration procedures
6. Execute capacity planning validation to ensure infrastructure can handle expected production load with appropriate safety margins
7. Validate compliance requirements including audit logging, data privacy controls, and regulatory requirement fulfillment
8. Test deployment automation including blue-green deployment processes, rollback procedures, and environment promotion workflows
9. Conduct final go/no-go assessment with operational teams to confirm production readiness and deployment approval

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Pre-production environments, performance testing platforms, security scanning systems, deployment automation tools
- **Tools & Systems:** Load testing frameworks, security validation tools, monitoring and alerting systems, compliance verification platforms
- **People & Teams:** Site reliability engineers, security teams, compliance officers, platform engineers, operations teams, release managers

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Confident production readiness validation, comprehensive performance verification, smooth operational procedure testing
- **Frustration Points:** Last-minute performance issues, complex compliance requirements, time pressure for release deadlines
- **Confidence Factors:** Production-identical environments, thorough testing coverage, clear go/no-go criteria, robust rollback procedures

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Environment Parity Challenges:** Pre-production environments that don't accurately mirror production leading to false confidence or missed issues
- **Performance Testing Complexity:** Difficult setup and execution of realistic load testing scenarios that accurately represent production usage patterns
- **Security Validation Bottlenecks:** Time-consuming manual security reviews and compliance checks causing delays in release cycles
- **Operational Procedure Gaps:** Insufficient testing of operational procedures and runbooks leading to production deployment difficulties
- **Cross-Team Coordination Overhead:** Complex coordination between development, operations, security, and compliance teams for final validation

### Workarounds
- **Simplified Performance Testing:** Using reduced complexity load testing when comprehensive performance validation is too time-consuming
- **Manual Security Reviews:** Relying on manual security and compliance checks when automated validation tools are insufficient
- **Production-First Testing:** Discovering issues in production when pre-production validation is incomplete or unreliable

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 24-72 hours per release including environment setup, comprehensive testing execution, and cross-team validation coordination
- **Skill Requirements:** Production operations expertise, performance testing knowledge, security and compliance understanding, release management skills
- **Cognitive Load:** High complexity requiring comprehensive understanding of production systems, operational procedures, and risk assessment
