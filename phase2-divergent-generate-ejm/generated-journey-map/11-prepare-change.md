# 11. Prepare Change

**Objective:** Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes
**Duration:** 1-2 days per deployment
**Frequency:** Once per production release, after pre-production validation is complete

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Create comprehensive change documentation that clearly describes deployment scope, risk assessment, and rollback procedures
- Obtain necessary approvals from stakeholders, security teams, and change review boards to authorize production deployment
- Coordinate deployment schedules with operations teams to minimize business impact and ensure resource availability
- Validate compliance with organizational change management policies and regulatory requirements before production access
- Ensure all deployment dependencies, prerequisites, and communication plans are clearly documented and agreed upon
- Establish clear go/no-go criteria and escalation procedures for deployment execution and potential rollback scenarios

### Actions
1. Document comprehensive change request including feature descriptions, technical impact analysis, and business justification
2. Complete risk assessment covering potential failure scenarios, impact analysis, and mitigation strategies for each identified risk
3. Create detailed deployment plan with step-by-step procedures, timing estimates, and resource requirements
4. Develop rollback procedures including trigger criteria, rollback steps, and recovery time estimates for deployment failures
5. Coordinate with operations teams to schedule deployment windows that minimize business disruption and ensure adequate support coverage
6. Submit change request through formal approval workflows including technical review, security assessment, and business approval
7. Communicate deployment plans to all affected teams including customer support, operations, and business stakeholders
8. Validate all deployment prerequisites including environment readiness, resource availability, and team member availability
9. Confirm final approval status and obtain formal authorization to proceed with production deployment

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Change management systems, deployment planning tools, risk assessment platforms, approval workflow systems
- **Tools & Systems:** Documentation platforms, scheduling and coordination tools, communication systems, compliance tracking tools
- **People & Teams:** Change review boards, security teams, operations managers, business stakeholders, customer support teams, release managers

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Smooth approval processes, clear governance requirements, comprehensive deployment preparation
- **Frustration Points:** Complex approval workflows, unclear change requirements, last-minute stakeholder concerns
- **Confidence Factors:** Thorough preparation documentation, clear approval criteria, strong rollback procedures, stakeholder alignment

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Complex Approval Workflows:** Time-consuming change management processes with unclear requirements and multiple approval gates causing deployment delays
- **Documentation Overhead:** Extensive manual documentation requirements for change requests that duplicate information already available in technical systems
- **Coordination Challenges:** Difficult scheduling and coordination across multiple teams for deployment windows and resource availability
- **Risk Assessment Complexity:** Challenging risk evaluation processes that require significant time investment but provide limited practical value
- **Last-Minute Approval Delays:** Stakeholder concerns or questions raised late in the approval process causing emergency schedule changes

### Workarounds
- **Simplified Change Requests:** Using minimal documentation when comprehensive change management processes are too burdensome
- **Informal Approvals:** Bypassing formal approval processes for urgent deployments when official workflows are too slow
- **Batch Deployment Scheduling:** Combining multiple changes into larger deployment windows to reduce approval overhead

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 8-16 hours per deployment including documentation creation, risk assessment, coordination, and approval follow-up
- **Skill Requirements:** Change management process knowledge, risk assessment capabilities, stakeholder communication skills, compliance understanding
- **Cognitive Load:** High complexity requiring comprehensive understanding of organizational processes, technical risks, and business impact considerations

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Automated Change Documentation:** Automatically generate change requests from deployment pipeline information with risk assessment and rollback procedures
- **Intelligent Risk Assessment:** Automated risk evaluation based on code changes, system dependencies, and historical deployment patterns

### Tooling Improvements
- **Integrated Change Management Platform:** Unified platform connecting technical deployment information with business approval workflows
- **Deployment Planning Dashboard:** Visual planning tools that automatically coordinate schedules, resources, and dependencies across teams
- **Risk Assessment Automation:** Tools that automatically evaluate deployment risks based on change analysis and historical data

### Process Optimization
- **Streamlined Approval Workflows:** Simplified change management processes that maintain governance requirements while reducing time and overhead
- **Automated Compliance Verification:** Built-in compliance checking that ensures change requests meet organizational and regulatory requirements
- **Self-Service Change Scheduling:** Automated coordination tools that enable teams to schedule deployments based on resource availability and business calendars

### Knowledge & Support
- **Change Management Templates:** Standardized, intelligent templates that auto-populate based on deployment characteristics and organizational requirements
- **Risk Assessment Guidance:** Integrated tools providing risk evaluation frameworks and historical deployment insight to improve assessment accuracy
- **Approval Process Documentation:** Clear, searchable guidance on change management requirements with automated compliance checking

## Success Metrics

### Current State Metrics
- **Change Approval Cycle Time:** 1-3 days from change request submission to final approval for production deployment
- **Approval Process Compliance:** 95% of production deployments follow complete change management approval processes
- **Change Request Rejection Rate:** 15% of change requests require additional information or modifications before approval

### Target Metrics
- **Change Approval Cycle Time:** 2-4 hours from automated change request generation to final approval for production deployment
- **Approval Process Compliance:** 100% of production deployments follow streamlined change management processes with automated compliance verification
- **Change Request Rejection Rate:** 5% of change requests require additional information with automated validation preventing most rejections

### Platform Impact Metrics
- **Change Documentation Automation:** 90% of change request content automatically generated from technical deployment information
- **Approval Workflow Efficiency:** 80% reduction in time spent by stakeholders on change review and approval activities
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy:** 95% of deployment risks accurately identified through automated risk assessment with historical deployment analysis
