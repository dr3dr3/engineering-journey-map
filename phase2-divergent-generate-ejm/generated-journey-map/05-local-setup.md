# 05. Local Setup

**Objective:** Setting up the tools needed for local development including IDE, container runtimes, git, and other development tooling  
**Duration:** 2-4 hours per project  
**Frequency:** Once per project or when changing development environments

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Configure a complete local development environment that mirrors production capabilities and team standards
- Successfully run existing applications locally with all dependencies and services functioning correctly
- Establish efficient development workflows with proper IDE integration, debugging capabilities, and testing frameworks
- Set up version control integration and ensure code contribution workflows are properly configured
- Validate environment setup by completing a simple development task or running existing test suites

### Actions
1. Clone project repositories and review local development documentation and requirements
2. Install and configure required development tools including IDEs, language runtimes, and package managers
3. Set up containerization tools (Docker, Docker Compose) and orchestration platforms for local service management
4. Configure database connections, external service dependencies, and environment variables for local development
5. Install and configure debugging tools, profilers, and local testing frameworks
6. Set up version control integration including SSH keys, commit signing, and branch management workflows
7. Run application startup scripts and validate all services are functioning correctly
8. Execute existing test suites to confirm environment is properly configured and ready for development

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Container registries, package repositories, configuration management systems, development environment automation
- **Tools & Systems:** IDEs (VS Code, IntelliJ), Docker Desktop, git, language-specific tools (npm, pip, gradle), local databases
- **People & Teams:** Development team members, platform engineering teams, DevOps specialists, documentation maintainers

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Automated setup scripts working smoothly, clear environment documentation, successful first application startup
- **Frustration Points:** Outdated setup instructions, dependency conflicts, platform-specific configuration issues, missing documentation
- **Confidence Factors:** Well-maintained development tools, responsive team support, comprehensive troubleshooting guides

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Environment Drift:** Local development configurations becoming inconsistent with production environments over time, causing deployment surprises
- **Dependency Hell:** Complex dependency management with version conflicts between projects and tools requiring manual resolution
- **Platform Inconsistencies:** Setup instructions that work on some operating systems but fail on others, creating team productivity gaps
- **Resource Requirements:** High memory and CPU usage from running multiple services locally, impacting development machine performance
- **Documentation Lag:** Setup documentation becoming outdated as projects evolve, leading to failed setup attempts and debugging time

### Workarounds
- **Personal Setup Scripts:** Engineers creating custom automation scripts to speed up environment setup across projects
- **Shared Development Environments:** Using remote development environments or shared staging systems when local setup is too complex
- **Simplified Local Stacks:** Running minimal service subsets locally while connecting to shared development services for complex dependencies

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 2-8 hours per project, with significant variability based on project complexity and documentation quality
- **Skill Requirements:** Command line proficiency, containerization knowledge, understanding of development tool ecosystems
- **Cognitive Load:** High initial complexity learning project-specific tooling and configuration patterns

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Environment Provisioning:** Automated development environment setup using containerized environments and infrastructure-as-code
- **Dependency Management:** Automated resolution and installation of project dependencies with version compatibility checking
- **Configuration Synchronization:** Automated sync of development environment configurations with production and staging systems

### Tooling Improvements
- **Development Environment as Code:** Standardized, version-controlled development environment definitions that can be provisioned automatically
- **One-Click Setup:** Integrated development environment setup that installs and configures all required tools through a single command
- **Environment Health Monitoring:** Automated checking of local environment health and automatic fixing of common configuration issues

### Process Optimization
- **Standardized Development Stacks:** Platform-provided standard development environments that reduce project-specific setup complexity
- **Progressive Environment Setup:** Layered approach allowing engineers to start with minimal setup and add complexity as needed
- **Environment Templates:** Pre-configured development environment templates for common project types and technology stacks

### Knowledge & Support
- **Interactive Setup Guides:** Step-by-step interactive guides that adapt to different operating systems and existing tool installations
- **Troubleshooting Automation:** Automated diagnostics that identify and resolve common development environment issues
- **Environment Documentation Portal:** Centralized hub for all development environment setup information with real-time updates
