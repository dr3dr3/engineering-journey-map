# 06. Local Development

**Objective:** Individual coding work, writing tests, debugging, and running code on the local environment  
**Duration:** 1-10 days per feature  
**Frequency:** Daily development activity throughout feature implementation

## Engineer Perspective

### Goals
- Implement feature requirements through clean, maintainable code that follows team coding standards and architectural patterns
- Write comprehensive test coverage including unit, integration, and component tests to ensure code quality and reliability
- Debug and resolve issues efficiently using local debugging tools and techniques without disrupting team workflows
- Validate feature functionality locally before submitting code for review, ensuring all acceptance criteria are met
- Maintain code quality through proper version control practices including meaningful commits and branch management

### Actions
1. Review feature requirements, acceptance criteria, and technical specifications before beginning implementation
2. Create feature branches following team naming conventions and implement code changes incrementally with frequent commits
3. Write and execute unit tests to validate individual functions and components, ensuring comprehensive test coverage
4. Run integration tests locally to verify feature interactions with existing codebase and external dependencies
5. Use debugging tools and techniques to identify and resolve issues, including breakpoints, logging, and performance profiling
6. Validate feature functionality by running the complete application locally and testing user workflows manually
7. Perform code reviews of own work using static analysis tools and linting to maintain quality standards
8. Update documentation including inline comments, README files, and technical specifications as needed

### Touchpoints
- **Platform Services:** Code repositories, CI/CD integration endpoints, code quality services, test execution platforms, documentation systems
- **Tools & Systems:** IDEs with debugging capabilities, test runners, code formatters and linters, version control clients, local build systems
- **People & Teams:** Development team members, code reviewers, QA engineers, product owners, technical leads

### Emotions & Experience
- **Positive Moments:** Efficient debugging sessions, comprehensive test suite providing confidence, smooth local development workflows
- **Frustration Points:** Slow test execution, complex debugging scenarios, flaky tests, context switching between multiple tools
- **Confidence Factors:** Reliable local environment, fast feedback loops, comprehensive development tooling, clear coding standards

## Current State Analysis

### Pain Points
- **Slow Feedback Loops:** Test suites taking too long to execute locally, slowing down development iteration and reducing productivity
- **Complex Debugging:** Difficult-to-reproduce issues requiring extensive debugging across multiple services and complex data scenarios
- **Test Environment Inconsistencies:** Local test results differing from CI/CD pipeline results due to environment configuration differences
- **Tool Integration Friction:** Poor integration between IDEs, testing frameworks, and debugging tools requiring manual context switching
- **Code Quality Variability:** Inconsistent application of coding standards and quality checks leading to review feedback cycles

### Workarounds
- **Selective Test Execution:** Running only subset of tests locally to reduce execution time, risking missing regression issues
- **External Service Mocking:** Creating complex mock configurations to avoid dependencies on external services during local development
- **Manual Quality Checks:** Manually running linters and formatters instead of automated integration within development workflow

### Effort & Complexity
- **Time Investment:** 6-8 hours daily focused development time with significant variation based on feature complexity and debugging requirements
- **Skill Requirements:** Proficiency in programming languages, testing frameworks, debugging techniques, and development tool ecosystems
- **Cognitive Load:** High concentration requirements with frequent context switching between coding, testing, and debugging activities

## Platform Engineering Opportunities

### Automation Potential
- **Intelligent Test Execution:** Automated selection and execution of relevant tests based on code changes to optimize feedback speed
- **Code Quality Automation:** Automated formatting, linting, and static analysis integrated into development workflow with real-time feedback
- **Debug Environment Provisioning:** Automated setup of debugging scenarios with appropriate data and service configurations

### Tooling Improvements
- **Unified Development Environment:** Integrated development experience combining coding, testing, and debugging in optimized workflows
- **Smart Test Runners:** Test execution tools that prioritize fast feedback and provide detailed failure analysis with suggested fixes
- **Enhanced Debugging Capabilities:** Advanced debugging tools with distributed tracing, performance profiling, and intelligent breakpoint management

### Process Optimization
- **Development Workflow Standards:** Standardized development processes that optimize for speed while maintaining quality and collaboration
- **Incremental Quality Gates:** Progressive quality checking that provides early feedback without blocking development flow
- **Context-Aware Development:** Development tools that understand project context and provide relevant suggestions and optimizations

### Knowledge & Support
- **Interactive Development Guides:** Context-sensitive help and best practices integrated into development tools and workflows
- **Debugging Knowledge Base:** Comprehensive troubleshooting resources with solutions to common development and debugging scenarios
- **Code Quality Training:** Integrated learning resources that help engineers improve code quality and development efficiency

## Success Metrics

### Current State Metrics
- **Daily Code Commits:** 3-5 meaningful commits per engineer per day with appropriate test coverage
- **Test Execution Time:** 15-30 minutes for full local test suite execution depending on project size
- **Debugging Resolution Time:** 2-4 hours average time to identify and resolve complex debugging scenarios

### Target Metrics
- **Development Velocity:** 20% increase in feature completion speed through improved tooling and workflow optimization
- **Test Execution Time:** Under 5 minutes for relevant test subset execution with comprehensive coverage feedback
- **Code Quality Score:** 95% automated code quality compliance with minimal manual intervention required

### Platform Impact Metrics
