# Understanding Customer Experience

For Platform Product Managers, understanding the current experience of internal engineers is not just beneficial—it's essential for platform success. When platforms are built without deep customer understanding, they often miss the mark entirely, requiring endless iterations and potentially facing abandonment by development teams.

## Importance of Customer-Centric Approach for Internal Platforms

### Treating Engineers as Customers

The Platform-as-a-Product approach mandates that platform teams treat internal development teams as their customers. This shift in mindset is crucial because:

- **Voluntary Adoption Drives Quality**: Platforms must be compelling enough that engineers choose to use them voluntarily. This creates natural pressure to build what developers actually need, not what platform teams think they need.

- **Path of Least Resistance**: Understanding the current experience helps identify friction points. The platform should make "the right thing the easiest thing to do" by removing obstacles that currently slow down engineers.

- **Avoiding the Golden Cage**: While platforms provide standardized workflows ("Golden Paths"), understanding current experiences ensures these paths don't become restrictive cages that limit necessary flexibility.

### The Cost of Misunderstanding

When platform teams fail to understand the current engineer experience:

- **Gap Between Perception and Reality**: Platform engineers often struggle to anticipate every developer requirement. The gap between what platform teams think developers need and what they actually need is typically enormous.

- **Endless Iteration Cycles**: Teams end up in classic startup-like cycles—building something, failing to deliver what's needed, then iterating endlessly until stumbling onto something useful.

- **Success Despite the Platform**: Teams may achieve their goals "in spite of the platform rather than because of it," damaging the platform's reputation and adoption.

## Methods for Gathering Engineer Feedback and Insights

### Structured Discovery Approaches

**Pain/Value Mapping**: Map current developer pain points to measurable business impacts. This helps translate technical frustrations into business language that stakeholders understand.

**Onboarding Loop Analysis**: Examine the current onboarding experience for new team members. How long does it take? What are the common stumbling blocks? Where do people get stuck?

**Journey Mapping**: Document the current end-to-end experience for common developer workflows (deployment, testing, debugging, etc.). Identify bottlenecks, workarounds, and pain points.

### Continuous Feedback Mechanisms

**Regular Check-ins**: Establish structured, recurring conversations with development teams to understand evolving needs and challenges.

**Developer Experience Surveys**: Implement systematic surveys to gather quantitative data on satisfaction, pain points, and desired improvements.

**Ticketing System Analysis**: Review support requests and help desk tickets to identify common issues and frustrations.

**Retrospective Integration**: Participate in or analyze team retrospectives to understand ongoing challenges in their development workflows.

## Impact of Poor Developer Experience on Productivity

### Measurable Business Impacts

Poor developer experience directly translates to measurable business losses:

- **Increased Lead Time**: Complex or broken development workflows slow down feature delivery
- **Reduced Deployment Frequency**: Difficult deployment processes discourage frequent releases
- **Higher Mean Time to Repair (MTTR)**: Poor tooling makes incident response slower
- **Increased Change Failure Rate**: Unreliable processes lead to more production issues

### Hidden Costs

Beyond direct metrics, poor developer experience creates:

- **Context Switching Overhead**: Engineers spending time on tooling issues instead of core development
- **Workaround Proliferation**: Teams creating shadow IT solutions that bypass problematic platform components
- **Talent Retention Issues**: Frustrated engineers may leave for organizations with better development experiences
- **Innovation Suppression**: Complex processes discourage experimentation and innovation

## How Understanding Current State Drives Better Platform Decisions

### Informed Prioritization

Understanding the current experience enables platform teams to:

- **Focus on High-Impact Areas**: Identify which pain points cause the most significant productivity losses
- **Sequence Improvements Logically**: Build solutions in an order that provides maximum relief fastest
- **Avoid Over-Engineering**: Resist building comprehensive solutions for minor problems

### Strategic Alignment

Current state understanding helps align platform investments with:

- **Business Objectives**: Connect platform improvements to measurable business outcomes
- **Developer Productivity Goals**: Ensure platform evolution supports actual development workflows
- **Compliance Requirements**: Build security and governance into solutions rather than as afterthoughts

### Build vs. Buy Decisions

Deep understanding of current experiences informs critical decisions about:

- **Custom Development**: When existing tools don't fit specific organizational needs
- **Tool Integration**: How to connect existing tools developers already use successfully
- **Migration Strategies**: How to transition from current state to improved future state with minimal disruption

## Conclusion

Understanding the current engineer experience is the foundation of successful platform engineering. It transforms platform development from a technology-first to a customer-first endeavor, ensuring that platform investments deliver real value to the engineers they serve and the business they support.

Without this understanding, platform teams risk building sophisticated solutions to problems that don't exist while missing opportunities to solve the real challenges that impact daily developer productivity and satisfaction.
