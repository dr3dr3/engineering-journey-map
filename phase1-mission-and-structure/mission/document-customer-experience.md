# Document Customer Experience

## Overview

Documenting the customer experience is fundamental to successful platform engineering. Platform Product Managers must systematically capture, analyze, and share insights about how engineers currently work to identify pain points, inefficiencies, and opportunities for platform improvements. This documentation serves as the foundation for building platforms that developers genuinely want to use.

## Methods for Data Collection

### Surveys and Questionnaires

**Developer Experience Surveys:**
- **Frequency:** Quarterly comprehensive surveys, monthly pulse surveys
