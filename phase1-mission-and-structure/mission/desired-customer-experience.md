# Desired Customer Experience

## Overview

Defining and communicating the desired future state customer experience is a critical responsibility for Platform Product Managers. This involves creating a compelling vision of how developers will interact with platform services once improvements are implemented, and providing clear pathways for achieving that vision. Success depends on making the future state tangible, measurable, and achievable through systematic change management.

## Vision Communication Strategies

### Creating Compelling Future State Narratives

**Day-in-the-Life Scenarios:**
- Develop detailed narratives showing how developers will experience the platform in the future state
- Create before-and-after comparisons that highlight specific pain point resolutions
- Use concrete examples with realistic timelines and metrics (e.g., "deployment will take 5 minutes instead of 2 hours")
- Include emotional benefits alongside functional improvements ("developers feel confident rather than anxious about deployments")

**Visual Communication Methods:**
- Create journey maps showing the improved developer experience flow
- Use storyboards or comic strips to illustrate complex process improvements
- Develop infographics showing key metrics improvements (deployment frequency, lead time reduction)
- Build interactive prototypes or mockups of future platform interfaces

**Multi-Stakeholder Messaging:**
- Tailor communication for different audiences (developers, leadership, security teams)
- Connect future state benefits to business outcomes for executive stakeholders
- Focus on reduced toil and increased autonomy for developer audiences
- Emphasize compliance-by-design and security improvements for governance stakeholders

### Building Shared Understanding

**Collaborative Visioning Sessions:**
- Facilitate workshops where developers help design their ideal experience
- Use design thinking methods to co-create future state scenarios
- Incorporate feedback from multiple teams to ensure broad applicability
- Document consensus decisions and trade-offs made during collaborative sessions

**Iterative Refinement:**
- Present initial future state visions for feedback and revision
- Test assumptions about desired outcomes with actual users
- Adjust vision based on technical feasibility and resource constraints
- Maintain version control of vision documents to track evolution

## Future State Documentation Methods

### Comprehensive Experience Documentation

**Developer Experience Blueprints:**
- Map all touchpoints between developers and platform services
- Document ideal interaction patterns for common workflows
- Include self-service capabilities and escalation paths
- Specify expected response times and service level objectives

**Service Interaction Specifications:**
- Define how developers will discover available platform services
- Describe intuitive onboarding flows for new team members
- Outline troubleshooting and support mechanisms
- Include integration patterns with existing development tools

**Success Criteria and Acceptance:**
- Establish measurable criteria for each aspect of the desired experience
- Define what "good enough" looks like for iterative delivery
- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative experience indicators
- Create validation methods for testing whether desired state has been achieved

### Living Documentation Practices

**Continuous Updates:**
- Maintain documentation that evolves with platform changes and new insights
- Use version control to track changes in desired state definition
- Include feedback incorporation processes and decision rationale
- Establish regular review cycles to ensure continued relevance

**Multi-Format Documentation:**
- Provide executive summaries for leadership consumption
- Create detailed implementation guides for engineering teams
- Develop quick-reference materials for day-to-day platform users
- Include video demonstrations and interactive tutorials where beneficial

## Change Management Approaches

### Organizational Change Strategy

**Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Identify champions within development teams to advocate for platform adoption
- Create pilot programs with early adopter teams to demonstrate value
- Establish feedback channels that ensure developer voices influence platform evolution
- Build cross-functional alignment between platform, security, and business teams

**Cultural Transformation:**
- Address mindset shifts required for platform-as-a-product adoption
- Promote self-service culture while maintaining necessary guardrails
- Celebrate early wins and success stories to build momentum
- Address resistance by understanding underlying concerns and constraints

**Communication Cascading:**
- Develop messaging that resonates at different organizational levels
- Train platform team members to effectively communicate vision and benefits
- Create materials that teams can use to explain platform value to their own stakeholders
- Establish regular communication cadences to maintain visibility and momentum

### Implementation Change Management

**Phased Rollout Planning:**
- Design incremental implementation that delivers value at each phase
- Create clear migration paths from current state to desired state
- Minimize disruption to existing development workflows during transition
- Provide fallback options and support during transition periods

**Training and Enablement:**
- Develop comprehensive training programs for platform adoption
- Create mentorship programs pairing experienced users with newcomers
- Provide just-in-time learning resources integrated into platform interfaces
- Establish office hours and support channels for real-time assistance

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Identify potential adoption barriers and develop mitigation strategies
- Plan for technical challenges that may arise during implementation
- Address security and compliance concerns proactively
- Create contingency plans for scenarios where desired outcomes are not achieved

## Measuring and Tracking Progress Toward Desired State

### Progress Tracking Framework

**Leading Indicators:**
- Platform adoption rates and team onboarding velocity
- Self-service success rates and support ticket trends
- Developer satisfaction scores and Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Training completion rates and certification achievements

**Lagging Indicators:**
- Deployment frequency and lead time improvements
- Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and change failure rate reductions
- Cost savings and productivity gains
- Business outcome improvements aligned with platform objectives

**Milestone Tracking:**
- Define specific checkpoints along the journey to desired state
- Create dashboards showing progress against key experience metrics
- Establish regular review cycles to assess progress and adjust strategy
- Document lessons learned and course corrections for future reference

### Feedback Loop Integration

**Continuous Measurement:**
- Implement regular developer experience surveys to track perception changes
- Monitor platform usage analytics to understand adoption patterns
- Conduct retrospectives to identify gaps between desired and actual experience
- Use A/B testing to validate specific experience improvements

**Adaptive Strategy:**
- Adjust desired state definition based on real-world implementation learnings
- Modify timelines and priorities based on actual adoption rates and feedback
- Incorporate new developer needs and pain points discovered during implementation
- Maintain flexibility to pivot strategies when data indicates better approaches

**Success Communication:**
- Regularly share progress updates with all stakeholders
- Celebrate milestone achievements and recognize team contributions
- Use success stories to build credibility and momentum for continued investment
- Document case studies that can be referenced for future platform initiatives

## Key Success Factors

### Vision Clarity and Alignment
- Ensure desired state is specific, measurable, and achievable
- Maintain alignment between platform vision and broader business objectives
- Create shared understanding across all stakeholder groups
- Balance ambitious improvement goals with realistic implementation constraints

### Developer-Centric Focus
- Keep actual developer needs and workflows at the center of all future state planning
- Validate desired state assumptions through direct developer feedback
- Prioritize improvements that deliver immediate and tangible value
- Maintain voluntary adoption principles throughout implementation

### Systematic Implementation
- Use proven change management methodologies adapted for platform contexts
- Maintain iterative delivery approaches that allow for learning and adjustment
