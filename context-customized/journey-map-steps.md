# Engineering Journey Map Generation Guide for AI Assistants

## Steps in the Engineering Journey Map
The Engineering Journey Map is comprised of the following steps in the set order. This represents the flow of the journey.

1. **Onboarding** - Getting new engineers set up with tools, environment, and team practices to start contributing effectively
2. **Planning Work** - Defining requirements, breaking down work into stories, estimating effort, and managing priorities for development sprints
3. **Architecture and Design** - Creating solution architectures, technical specifications, and design patterns before development begins
4. **QA Pre-Development** - Planning testing strategies, creating test cases, and preparing test environments before coding starts
5. **Local Setup** - Setting up the tools needed for local development including IDE, container run times, git, and other development tooling
6. **Local Development** - Individual coding work, writing tests, debugging, and running code on the local environment
7. **QA Isolated** - Testing individual features or changes in controlled environments separate from other ongoing work
8. **QA Integrated** - Testing how multiple components work together across services and systems
9. **QA User Acceptance** - Validating software meets business requirements and user expectations with stakeholder involvement
10. **QA Pre-Production** - Final validation in production-like environments before go-live decisions
11. **Prepare Change** - Preparing formal change requests and approvals for production deployment through governance processes
12. **Deploy Production** - Executing production deployments safely with minimal downtime and comprehensive validation
13. **Release to Customers** - Controlling feature rollouts to customers using feature flags and progressive release strategies
14. **QA Production** - Monitoring and validating production functionality after customer release to catch issues early
15. **Monitor** - Tracking system health metrics, alerts, and SLAs to maintain production service reliability
16. **Observe and Support** - Responding to production incidents, troubleshooting issues, and coordinating resolution efforts
17. **Assess and Feedback** - Collecting and analyzing customer feedback to identify improvement opportunities and measure satisfaction
18. **Manage Tech Debt** - Systematically identifying, prioritizing, and addressing technical debt alongside feature development
19. **Grow Capabilities** - Developing individual and team skills through learning programs, mentorship, and knowledge sharing
20. **Continuous Improvement** - Identifying process improvements, running experiments, and fostering a culture of ongoing enhancement
