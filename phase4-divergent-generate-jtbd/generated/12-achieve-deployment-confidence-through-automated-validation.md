## Current Struggle Timeline

### Deployment Execution and Initial Validation (Time 0-15 minutes)
**Situation:** Starting deployment execution while monitoring for immediate issues  
**Push Forces:**
- Limited real-time visibility into deployment progress across distributed systems creating uncertainty about execution status
- Manual validation procedures requiring expert knowledge and time-intensive health checking across multiple services
- Complex cross-service health validation requiring coordination and manual verification of service integration
- Service dependency monitoring gaps making it difficult to detect cascading issues early in deployment process

**Pull Forces:**
- Automated health check execution providing immediate feedback about service status and deployment progress
- Real-time monitoring dashboards showing comprehensive system health and performance metrics during deployment
- Distributed tracing integration enabling visibility into cross-service communication and request flow validation

### Comprehensive System Validation (Time 15-45 minutes)
**Situation:** Validating service health, performance, and integration across distributed systems  
**Push Forces:**
- "2-6 hours average validation time including preparation, coordination, execution, and post-deployment verification"
- Manual smoke testing and integration validation requiring extensive coordination across multiple engineering teams
- Database migration validation requiring manual verification of schema changes and cross-service data integrity
- Performance regression detection requiring manual analysis of metrics and comparison with baseline performance

**Habit Forces:**
- Simplified validation procedures when comprehensive testing requires excessive coordination and manual oversight
- Conservative validation approaches relying on extensive monitoring rather than proactive automated validation
- Manual rollback decision-making based on incomplete or uncertain validation data and subjective risk assessment

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that validation gaps will miss critical issues causing customer impact after deployment completion
- Concern about false confidence from automated validation that doesn't detect real-world edge cases and usage patterns
- Worry about time pressure for validation decisions affecting thoroughness and deployment success assessment

### Deployment Decision and Completion (Time 45-90 minutes)
**Situation:** Making final deployment success assessment and rollback/promotion decision  
**Push Forces:**
- Subjective deployment success assessment without clear automated criteria for rollback or promotion decisions
- Manual coordination for final deployment approval requiring stakeholder alignment and expert judgment
- Complex rollback decision-making under time pressure without comprehensive data about deployment impact
- Limited automated sign-off procedures requiring manual verification across security, performance, and operational criteria

**Pull Forces:**
- Clear automated success indicators providing objective criteria for deployment assessment and decision-making
- Comprehensive validation reporting with visual dashboards showing all critical deployment metrics and health indicators
- Automated rollback triggering based on predefined performance and health thresholds with immediate recovery capability
