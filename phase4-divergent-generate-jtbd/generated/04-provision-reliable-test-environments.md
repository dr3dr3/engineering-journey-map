## Current Struggle Timeline

### Environment Planning Phase (Day 1-2)
**Situation:** Determining test environment requirements and provisioning approach  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual test environment setup requiring "hours or days" with uncertain availability
- Complex environment configuration across multiple technology stacks with different infrastructure requirements
- Resource competition for shared test environments causing conflicts between teams
- "Test environments are often unavailable or in weird states" based on survey feedback

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional commitment to reliable testing infrastructure and consistent environment configuration
- Team expectation for immediate environment availability when testing begins
- Personal desire to eliminate environment-related bottlenecks and configuration issues

### Environment Provisioning Phase (Day 2-4)
**Situation:** Setting up and configuring test environments for comprehensive testing  
**Push Forces:**
- Infrastructure as Code complexity requiring specialized knowledge and manual intervention
- Cross-stack integration requirements needing coordination across multiple environment types
- Test data management challenges requiring privacy-compliant, realistic data generation
- "Complex test environment configuration" creating unreliable testing conditions

**Habit Forces:**
- Personal development environments used to avoid shared environment conflicts ("works on my machine" scenarios)
- Manual environment coordination through "email chains and spreadsheets" for resource management
- Copy-paste configuration approaches without proper Infrastructure as Code automation
- Reactive environment troubleshooting rather than proactive monitoring and maintenance

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that environment issues will delay testing timeline and impact development velocity
- Concern about environment configuration differences causing testing inaccuracy
- Worry about resource conflicts disrupting other teams' testing activities
- Stress from manual environment management complexity and maintenance overhead

### Environment Validation Phase (Day 4-5)
**Situation:** Confirming environment readiness and executing initial testing validation  
**Pull Forces:**
- Successful test execution when environments are properly configured and stable
- Team productivity gains when environment provisioning is automated and reliable
- Professional satisfaction from Infrastructure as Code implementation and environment standardization

**Remaining Struggles:**
- Environment health monitoring and automated issue detection requiring manual oversight
- Cross-technology stack coordination for full-stack integration testing environments
- Test data refresh and privacy compliance management across multiple environment types
- Environment cleanup and resource optimization requiring manual coordination and cost management

## Desired Progress Definition

### Functional Success Metrics
- **Provisioning Speed:** 15-30 minutes automated environment setup from request to full configuration and readiness
- **Environment Reliability:** 95% uptime for test environments with automated health monitoring and issue resolution

## Current Solution Landscape

### Existing Approaches
- **Manual Environment Setup:** Using cloud console interfaces and manual configuration for test environment creation
- **Shared Environment Coordination:** Team-based scheduling and communication for shared test environment usage
- **Infrastructure as Code Templates:** Terraform and similar tools for automated environment provisioning with manual customization
- **Personal Development Environments:** Individual local setups to avoid shared environment conflicts and availability issues

### Alternative Solutions Engineers Consider
- **Containerized Environment Strategy:** Docker and Kubernetes-based environments for consistent, isolated testing infrastructure
- **Cloud-Native Environment Automation:** Serverless and managed service approaches for reducing environment management overhead
- **Environment-as-a-Service Platforms:** Third-party tools providing automated test environment provisioning and management
- **Self-Service Infrastructure Platforms:** Internal developer platforms enabling automated environment provisioning through standardized interfaces

### Non-Consumption Scenarios
- **Testing in Production-Like Environments:** Using staging or pre-production environments instead of dedicated test infrastructure
- **Minimal Environment Testing:** Using simplified environments that don't fully replicate production conditions
- **Sequential Environment Usage:** Waiting for shared environments rather than provisioning dedicated testing infrastructure
- **Local-Only Testing:** Limiting testing to individual development environments without integrated testing infrastructure

## Platform Engineering Innovation Opportunities
