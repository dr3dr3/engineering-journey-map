- Experience certainty that comprehensive validation has been performed
- Reduce stress from potential production failures or emergency rollbacks
- Build professional credibility through consistent, successful production deployments
- Feel empowered to make deployment decisions based on objective criteria

### Social Dimension
- Be seen as thorough and responsible in production readiness validation
- Demonstrate reliability to stakeholders through consistent validation practices
- Build trust with operations and security teams through comprehensive testing
- Establish reputation for deployment excellence and risk mitigation
- Contribute to team culture of production quality and operational excellence

## Current Struggle Timeline

### Pre-Production Environment Setup (Day -2 to 0)
**Situation:** Preparing validation environment and test scenarios  
**Push Forces:**
- Frustration with environment configuration drift from production systems
- Time-intensive manual setup of realistic performance testing scenarios
- Complexity of coordinating security reviews and compliance validation
- Resource constraints limiting comprehensive testing coverage

**Pull Forces:**
- Desire to catch production issues before deployment
- Motivation to validate comprehensive system behavior
- Team expectation for thorough pre-production validation

### Comprehensive Validation Execution (Day 1-2)
**Situation:** Running performance, security, and operational tests  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual coordination overhead across development, operations, and security teams
- Complex performance testing requiring significant setup and execution time
- Security validation bottlenecks requiring manual reviews and approvals
- Insufficient production-like data limiting validation effectiveness

**Habit Forces:**
- Simplified testing scenarios when comprehensive validation is too complex
- Manual workarounds when automated validation tools are inadequate
- Conservative deployment strategies to compensate for validation uncertainty
- Reliance on production monitoring rather than pre-production validation

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of missing critical issues that could cause production failures
- Worry about deployment timeline delays due to validation complexity
- Concern about false confidence from unrealistic validation environments
- Stress about coordinating multiple stakeholder approvals for production deployment

### Production Readiness Decision (Day 2-3)
**Situation:** Making final go/no-go decision for production deployment  
**Push Forces:**
- Subjective decision-making without clear production readiness criteria
- Pressure to deploy despite incomplete or uncertain validation results
- Cross-team coordination complexity for final deployment approval
- Risk assessment based on incomplete or inconsistent validation data

**Pull Forces:**
- Satisfaction from comprehensive validation providing deployment confidence
- Clear data-driven production readiness scoring and risk assessment
- Streamlined decision-making with automated validation criteria
- Stakeholder confidence in deployment decisions based on objective evidence

## Desired Progress Definition

## Current Solution Landscape

### Existing Approaches
- **Manual Environment Setup:** Creating pre-production environments through ClickOps and partial Infrastructure-as-Code
- **Simplified Performance Testing:** Reduced complexity load testing scenarios that miss critical edge cases
- **Manual Security Reviews:** Time-intensive manual security and compliance validation with significant coordination overhead
- **Staged Validation Process:** Sequential validation across multiple teams with manual coordination and approval workflows

### Alternative Solutions Engineers Consider
- **Production-First Deployment:** Accepting production deployment risks when pre-production validation is too complex
- **Conservative Release Strategy:** Batching multiple features to justify extensive validation overhead
- **Progressive Rollout:** Using feature flags and canary deployments to minimize initial production exposure
- **Enhanced Monitoring:** Relying on comprehensive production monitoring rather than pre-production validation

### Non-Consumption Scenarios
- **Validation Avoidance:** Skipping comprehensive validation when manual processes are too complex
- **Minimal Testing:** Performing basic validation that misses critical production scenarios
- **Risk Acceptance:** Proceeding with deployment despite incomplete validation due to timeline pressure
- **Reactive Issue Management:** Addressing production issues post-deployment rather than preventing through validation
