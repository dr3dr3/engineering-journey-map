## Current Struggle Timeline

### Testing Responsibility Planning Phase (Day 1-2)
**Situation:** Defining testing ownership and coordination requirements across teams  
**Push Forces:**
- "Testing them together is where everything falls apart" with each technology stack having different testing frameworks
- Unclear testing boundaries between teams leading to gaps in integration coverage
- Cross-team coordination requiring "4-5 different tools" making responsibility tracking complex
- Full-stack engineers reporting integration testing as primary challenge area

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional commitment to comprehensive testing coverage and successful integration delivery
- Team expectation for clear testing ownership and coordination protocols
- Personal desire to prevent integration failures through systematic coordination

### Coordination Establishment Phase (Day 2-3)
**Situation:** Setting up communication channels and coordination processes for cross-team testing  
**Push Forces:**
- Integration testing platforms requiring manual coordination between different technology stacks
- "Coordination overhead" consuming significant engineering time and focus
- Testing handoff points lacking automated notifications and status tracking
- Cross-team testing environments needing manual scheduling and resource coordination

**Habit Forces:**
- Over-reliance on informal communication channels and personal relationships for coordination
- Manual tracking of testing status across teams using individual tools and spreadsheets
- Sequential testing approaches rather than coordinated parallel testing execution
- Reactive coordination responding to integration issues rather than proactive planning

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that testing gaps between teams will cause production integration failures
- Concern about coordination overhead impacting development velocity and team autonomy
- Worry about unclear testing ownership leading to duplicated effort or missed scenarios
- Stress from managing multiple stakeholder relationships and conflicting team priorities

### Testing Execution Coordination (Day 3-5)
**Situation:** Managing ongoing coordination during cross-team testing execution  
**Pull Forces:**
- Successful integration delivery when cross-team testing coordination works effectively
- Team productivity when testing handoffs are smooth and well-coordinated
- Professional recognition for facilitating effective cross-team collaboration and integration success

**Remaining Struggles:**
- Real-time visibility into cross-team testing status and progress requiring manual check-ins
- Integration testing failures requiring coordinated debugging across multiple teams and technology stacks
- Testing timeline adjustments needing rapid communication and re-coordination across teams
- Resource conflicts in shared testing environments requiring ongoing coordination and conflict resolution
