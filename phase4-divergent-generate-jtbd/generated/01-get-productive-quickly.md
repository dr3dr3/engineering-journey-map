## Job Statement

**When** I join a new engineering team or organization,  
**I want to** become productive and able to contribute meaningful work as quickly as possible,  
**So I can** demonstrate my value, build confidence in my abilities, and start making a positive impact on team goals.

## Job Context

### Functional Dimension
- Access all necessary development tools and systems
- Set up complete development environment with minimal friction
- Understand the codebase structure and architecture
- Learn deployment processes and development workflows
- Navigate organizational systems and processes efficiently

### Emotional Dimension
- Feel confident and capable rather than overwhelmed
- Experience a sense of belonging and welcome from the team
- Reduce anxiety about job performance in early weeks
- Build momentum through early wins and successful contributions
- Feel supported rather than burdensome to existing team members

### Social Dimension
- Be perceived as competent and valuable by new colleagues
- Establish positive working relationships with team members
- Demonstrate ability to learn and adapt quickly
- Avoid being seen as someone who requires excessive hand-holding
- Integrate seamlessly into existing team dynamics

## Current Struggle Timeline

### Initial Recognition (Day -30 to 0)
**Situation:** Job offer accepted, anticipating start date  
**Push Forces:**
- Anxiety about starting at new company
- Uncertainty about tools and processes
- Pressure to prove hiring decision was correct

**Pull Forces:**
- Excitement about new opportunities
- Desire to apply skills in new context
- Anticipation of learning new technologies

### First Week Reality (Day 1-5)
**Situation:** Beginning actual work  
**Push Forces:**
- Frustration with multiple login systems (current: "15 different tools")
- Overwhelm from scattered documentation and unclear priorities
- Complexity of local environment setup ("really overwhelming", laptops "sounding like jet engines")
- Waiting for hardware procurement and manual approvals

**Habit Forces:**
- Reliance on previous company's familiar tools and processes
- Tendency to ask colleagues for help rather than search documentation
- Preference for hands-on learning over reading extensive guides

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of appearing incompetent or slow to learn
- Concern about disrupting team productivity
- Worry about making mistakes in unfamiliar systems

### Breakthrough Moments (Day 3-14)
**Situation:** First successful contribution  
**Pull Forces:**
- Successfully completing first assigned task
- Positive feedback from mentor or team lead
- Understanding team workflows and being able to participate

**Remaining Struggles:**
- Role-specific gaps (data engineers lacking appropriate documentation)
- Heavy reliance on senior engineers for setup assistance
- Time investment of 40-80 hours over 1-2 weeks

## Desired Progress Definition

### Functional Success Metrics
- **Access Achievement:** Single sign-on to all necessary tools within first day
- **Environment Ready:** Complete development environment setup in <2 hours
- **First Contribution:** Meaningful code contribution or bug fix within 3-5 days
- **Self-Sufficiency:** 90% of setup completed without support tickets

### Emotional Success Metrics
- **Confidence Building:** Feel capable and supported rather than overwhelmed
- **Reduced Anxiety:** Clear path forward with predictable milestones
- **Early Wins:** Quick successes that build momentum and motivation
- **Team Integration:** Feel welcomed and valued by team members

### Social Success Metrics
- **Positive Perception:** Seen as quick learner who adds value
- **Minimal Disruption:** Require minimal support from busy team members
- **Effective Relationships:** Build productive working relationships with key contacts
- **Professional Credibility:** Establish reputation as competent and reliable

## Current Solution Landscape

### Existing Approaches
- **Buddy System:** Informal pairing with experienced team members
- **Documentation Repositories:** Scattered guides and setup instructions
- **IT Support Tickets:** Manual assistance for tool access and environment setup
- **Trial and Error:** Self-directed exploration of tools and systems

### Alternative Solutions Engineers Consider
- **Personal Setup Scripts:** Creating custom automation to bypass official procedures
- **Colleague Shadowing:** Following experienced developers to learn workflows
- **External Resources:** Using online tutorials and documentation when internal guides fail
- **Tool Alternatives:** Suggesting familiar tools from previous companies

### Non-Consumption Scenarios
- **Delayed Start:** Taking longer than expected to become productive
- **Partial Productivity:** Working around missing tools or incomplete setup
- **Help Dependency:** Continuing to rely heavily on colleagues for basic tasks

## Platform Engineering Innovation Opportunities

### Underserved Aspects of the Job
- **Role-Specific Guidance:** Current onboarding is one-size-fits-all
- **Progressive Information Delivery:** Information overload vs. need-to-know timing
- **Environment Standardization:** Inconsistent setup across different technology stacks
- **Automated Progress Tracking:** No visibility into onboarding completion status

### Jobs-to-be-Done Adjacent Opportunities
- **Continuous Learning:** Ongoing skill development beyond initial onboarding
- **Team Integration:** Social and cultural onboarding beyond technical setup
- **Knowledge Transfer:** Effective handoff of context from previous projects
- **Productivity Optimization:** Personal workflow setup and customization

### Technology Enablers
- **Unified Developer Portal:** Single entry point with role-specific dashboards
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Automated environment provisioning
- **Automated Account Provisioning:** Trigger-based setup across all systems
- **Interactive Learning Modules:** Hands-on tutorials combined with actual configuration

## Success Measurement Framework

### Leading Indicators
- Time from account creation to first successful login across all systems
- Number of support tickets generated during first week
- Completion rate of onboarding checklist items
- Time spent by senior engineers providing setup assistance

### Lagging Indicators
- Time to first meaningful code contribution
- Onboarding satisfaction scores from new engineers
- 30-day and 90-day retention rates
- Time to independent productivity (working without regular support)

### Platform Impact Metrics
- Reduction in onboarding-related support requests
- Increase in self-service completion rates
- Improvement in new engineer satisfaction scores
- Decrease in time-to-productivity variance across different roles

This job represents the foundational need that drives all onboarding improvements and provides a clear lens for evaluating platform engineering investments in developer experience.
