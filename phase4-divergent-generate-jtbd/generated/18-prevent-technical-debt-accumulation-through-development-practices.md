**Pull Forces:**
- Reduced technical debt accumulation creating positive feedback loop that demonstrates value of prevention practices
- Improved development confidence through systematic quality and reduced anxiety about creating future technical burden
- Team efficiency improvement through prevention of technical debt that would otherwise require future cleanup efforts

### Sustainable Practice Establishment (Month 4+)
**Situation:** Maintaining technical debt prevention as natural part of development workflow and team culture  
**Push Forces:**
- Continuous vigilance required to prevent regression to old practices that create technical debt when under delivery pressure
- Ongoing tool and practice improvement needed to maintain effectiveness of technical debt prevention as system complexity grows

**Pull Forces:**
- Development velocity improvement from reduced technical debt accumulation creating sustainable high-performance development environment
