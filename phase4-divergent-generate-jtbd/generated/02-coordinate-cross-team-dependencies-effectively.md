- Establish clear integration contracts and communication protocols for collaborative work
- Plan buffer time and risk mitigation strategies for dependency-related delays
- Track dependency status and communicate updates proactively to all affected parties

### Emotional Dimension
- Feel confident that cross-team work is properly coordinated rather than anxious about unknown blockers
- Experience control over integration timeline rather than helplessness about external dependencies
- Build trust through reliable communication and follow-through on dependency commitments
- Reduce stress from last-minute coordination crises and timeline surprises
- Feel empowered to negotiate dependency timelines based on clear visibility and communication

### Social Dimension
- Be recognized as effective cross-team collaborator who facilitates smooth integration
- Build professional relationships across engineering organization through consistent, reliable coordination
- Demonstrate leadership in managing complex, multi-team initiatives
- Enable other team members to focus on development rather than coordination overhead
- Contribute to organizational effectiveness by preventing integration bottlenecks

## Current Struggle Timeline

### Planning Phase Dependency Discovery (Day -2 to 0)
**Situation:** Analyzing stories for potential cross-team dependencies  
**Push Forces:**
- Hidden dependencies not identified until development begins
- Difficulty tracking coordination requirements across "4-5 different tools"
- Lack of visibility into other teams' roadmaps and capacity
- Complex integration points with unclear interface definitions

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional commitment to successful delivery and team coordination
- Team expectation for thorough planning and risk identification
- Personal desire to prevent development bottlenecks and delays

### Coordination Initiation (Day 1-3)
**Situation:** Reaching out to dependent teams and establishing collaboration  
**Push Forces:**
- Informal coordination channels ("private Slack channels and hallway conversations") creating information silos
- Time zone and meeting coordination challenges for distributed teams
- Competing priorities and resource constraints across teams
- Unclear escalation paths for dependency resolution

**Habit Forces:**
- Over-communication through multiple informal channels to ensure alignment
- Personal relationship dependency rather than systematic coordination processes
- Reactive coordination responding to blockers rather than proactive planning
- Individual tracking tools outside official project management systems

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that other teams won't prioritize dependency work appropriately
- Concern about timeline impact from delayed or changed dependency deliverables
- Worry about team reputation if cross-team coordination fails
- Stress from managing multiple stakeholder relationships and conflicting priorities

### Development Phase Coordination (Day 4-14)
**Situation:** Managing ongoing dependency coordination during sprint execution  
**Pull Forces:**
- Successful integration delivery when coordination works effectively
- Positive cross-team relationships built through reliable collaboration
- Team satisfaction when dependencies don't become blockers

**Remaining Struggles:**
- Mid-sprint changes in dependency timeline or scope
- "Coordination overhead" consuming significant engineering time
- Integration testing challenges when dependent systems aren't ready
- Communication gaps leading to incompatible implementation approaches

## Desired Progress Definition

### Functional Success Metrics
- **Dependency Identification:** 95% of cross-team dependencies identified during planning phase
- **Coordination Efficiency:** 50% reduction in coordination overhead through systematic processes
- **Timeline Predictability:** 90% of dependency-related commitments delivered on original timeline
- **Integration Success:** First-time integration success rate above 85% for planned dependencies

### Emotional Success Metrics
- **Coordination Confidence:** Feel competent managing complex cross-team initiatives
- **Proactive Control:** Experience empowerment through early dependency identification and management
- **Reduced Stress:** Minimize anxiety from unknown blockers and coordination surprises
- **Professional Satisfaction:** Build track record of successful cross-team collaboration and delivery

### Social Success Metrics
- **Cross-Team Reputation:** Be recognized as reliable, effective coordinator across engineering organization
- **Leadership Recognition:** Demonstrate capability for managing complex, multi-team technical initiatives
- **Team Enablement:** Enable team members to focus on development through effective dependency management

- **Meeting-Heavy Coordination:** Regular sync meetings and check-ins across multiple teams
- **Documentation-Based Tracking:** Confluence pages and shared documents for dependency tracking
- **Project Management Integration:** Jira links and epic structures for formal dependency representation

### Alternative Solutions Engineers Consider
- **Architecture Review Boards:** Formal technical review processes for cross-team integration planning
- **Service Mesh Integration:** Technical infrastructure that reduces coordination requirements through standard interfaces
- **API-First Development:** Contract-driven development reducing coordination complexity
- **Internal Developer Platforms:** Self-service tools that minimize direct team-to-team coordination needs

### Non-Consumption Scenarios
- **Dependency Avoidance:** Choosing simpler implementations that don't require cross-team coordination
- **Sequential Development:** Waiting for dependencies to complete before beginning related work
- **Isolation Strategy:** Building temporary workarounds or mocks to avoid dependency coordination
- **Escalation Dependency:** Relying on management to resolve coordination challenges rather than direct collaboration
