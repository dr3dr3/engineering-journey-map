## Current Struggle Timeline

### Initial Change Analysis (Day -3 to -2)
**Situation:** Beginning comprehensive risk assessment for production deployment  
**Push Forces:**
- Complex technical changes requiring analysis across multiple system layers and service dependencies
- Limited access to historical deployment patterns and failure analysis for informed risk evaluation
- Subjective risk assessment processes requiring significant time investment while providing limited practical value
- Pressure to provide quick risk assessment without comprehensive analysis tools or historical data access

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional responsibility for accurate risk evaluation and stakeholder protection from deployment issues
- Stakeholder dependency on expert technical assessment for informed approval decisions
- Personal commitment to production system reliability and organizational risk management

### Risk Assessment Creation (Day -2 to -1)
**Situation:** Developing comprehensive risk analysis and documentation  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual risk evaluation requiring extensive research without automated analysis tools or pattern recognition
- Difficulty translating technical risks into business impact terms that stakeholders can understand and evaluate
- Inconsistent risk assessment criteria creating uncertainty about evaluation standards and approval likelihood
- Time pressure to complete risk analysis while maintaining thoroughness and accuracy

**Habit Forces:**
- Using personal experience and intuition rather than data-driven risk assessment methodologies
- Focusing on obvious technical risks while potentially missing subtle interaction effects or dependency issues
- Creating conservative risk assessments to protect against approval of potentially dangerous changes

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of missing critical risks that could cause production incidents and damage professional reputation
- Concern about accuracy of risk assessment without comprehensive historical data or automated analysis tools
- Worry about stakeholder confidence in risk evaluation accuracy and decision-making recommendations

### Stakeholder Communication (Day -1 to 0)
**Situation:** Presenting risk assessment to stakeholders for approval decisions  
**Push Forces:**
- Technical complexity that is difficult to communicate clearly to non-technical stakeholders
- Stakeholder questions requiring additional analysis or clarification of risk factors and mitigation strategies
- Different stakeholder groups with varying risk tolerance and decision-making criteria

**Pull Forces:**
- Stakeholder appreciation for clear, comprehensive risk analysis that enables informed decision-making
- Professional recognition for accurate risk assessment that balances deployment safety with business needs
- Successful deployments that validate risk assessment accuracy and build trust in evaluation capabilities

### Post-Decision Analysis (Day 0 to +3)
**Situation:** Monitoring deployment results and validating risk assessment accuracy  
**Success Indicators:**
- Deployment proceeds without incidents that were not identified in risk assessment
- Stakeholders express confidence in risk evaluation accuracy and decision-making support
- Risk assessment insights contribute to improved deployment practices and organizational learning

## Desired Progress Definition

### Functional Success Metrics
- **Risk Assessment Accuracy:** 90% of deployment risks accurately identified through systematic analysis and historical pattern recognition
- **Communication Effectiveness:** 95% of stakeholders understand risk analysis and feel confident in decision-making information
- **Assessment Efficiency:** Risk evaluation completed within 2-4 hours rather than requiring days of manual analysis
- **Predictive Quality:** Risk assessment insights validated by actual deployment outcomes and incident correlation

### Emotional Success Metrics
- **Professional Confidence:** Feel skilled and competent in technical risk assessment and stakeholder communication
- **Assessment Certainty:** Experience confidence that risk evaluation comprehensively covers potential deployment issues
