## Current Struggle Timeline

### Context Gathering Phase (Day 1-2)
**Situation:** Attempting to understand existing architecture and patterns  
**Push Forces:**
- Architecture information "scattered across multiple Confluence spaces" making it difficult to find comprehensive context
- Documentation that is outdated or doesn't reflect current system implementation
- "Tool fragmentation" requiring navigation between multiple systems to gather complete picture
- Time pressure to begin design work before fully understanding architectural landscape

**Pull Forces:**
- Desire to create designs that fit well with existing system architecture
- Professional motivation to understand and follow organizational best practices
- Team expectation to produce designs quickly and efficiently

### Design Decision Making (Day 2-3)
**Situation:** Making architectural choices without sufficient organizational context  
**Push Forces:**
- "Lack of established design patterns" forcing custom solutions for common problems
- Uncertainty about which architectural principles and standards apply to specific situations
- Limited access to architectural decision records (ADRs) and reasoning behind existing choices
- Difficulty understanding system dependencies and potential integration challenges

**Habit Forces:**
- Defaulting to familiar technology choices rather than organizational standards
- Creating "copy-paste architecture" from visible examples without understanding underlying patterns
- Avoiding architectural complexity to reduce potential review friction
- Working in isolation rather than seeking collaborative design input

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of creating designs that conflict with unstated organizational architectural principles
- Concern about making decisions that will be rejected due to lack of architectural context
- Worry about discovering critical dependencies or constraints after design completion
- Pressure to appear competent while lacking access to necessary architectural knowledge

### Review and Validation Bottlenecks (Day 3-5)
**Situation:** Seeking validation from limited architectural expertise  
**Push Forces:**
- "Senior architect availability limiting design review capacity" creating scheduling bottlenecks
- Review feedback that references architectural context not available during design creation
- Multiple review cycles due to lack of organizational pattern understanding
- Unclear criteria for what constitutes acceptable architectural decisions

**Pull Forces:**
- Positive validation when designs align with organizational architectural standards
- Learning from architect feedback improving future design decision-making
- Approval enabling progression to implementation phase

**Remaining Struggles:**
- 30% of designs requiring "significant rework after initial review" due to architectural misalignment
- Extended review cycles consuming 5-10 days average time from submission to approval
- Inconsistent feedback highlighting different aspects of organizational architectural standards
