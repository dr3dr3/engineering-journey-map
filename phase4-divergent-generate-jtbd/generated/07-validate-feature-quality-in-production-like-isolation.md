**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that environment differences will mask critical production issues
- Concern about time investment without reliable test result validation
- Worry about resource constraints affecting comprehensive testing coverage
- Stress about progressing to integration with incomplete confidence in feature quality

### Result Analysis and Decision Phase (Hour 4-8)
**Situation:** Analyzing test results and making integration readiness decisions  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual analysis requiring correlation of results across multiple services and test scenarios
- Uncertainty about whether test coverage adequately represents production complexity
- Difficulty identifying root causes for distributed system test failures
- Limited observability making it challenging to understand feature behavior patterns

**Pull Forces:**
- Satisfaction from comprehensive test validation and clear quality metrics
- Confidence when test results demonstrate feature readiness for integration
- Professional recognition for delivering thoroughly tested, high-quality features

**Success Indicators:**
- Clear evidence that feature functions correctly across all tested scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage with automated validation and clear pass/fail criteria
- Performance validation demonstrating acceptable resource usage and response times
- Confident progression to integration testing with documented quality assurance

**Failure Scenarios:**
- False confidence from incomplete testing that misses production-like scenarios
- Test results that raise questions but don't provide clear guidance for remediation
- Time overruns affecting development sprint commitments and team velocity
