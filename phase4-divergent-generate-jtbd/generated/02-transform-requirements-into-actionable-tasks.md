## Current Struggle Timeline

### Initial Requirement Review (Day -3 to -1)
**Situation:** Receiving and analyzing new features or requirements  
**Push Forces:**
- Frustration with vague requirements and missing business context
- Large features that seem impossible to complete within sprint timeframes
- Pressure to start development before proper analysis and breakdown
- Unclear acceptance criteria leading to ambiguous success definitions

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional desire to understand and solve business problems effectively
- Team dependency on clear task breakdown for sprint planning success
- Personal commitment to quality delivery and sustainable development practices

### Requirement Clarification Process (Day -2 to 0)
**Situation:** Working with product managers and stakeholders to clarify scope  
**Push Forces:**
- "30-40% of planning time spent clarifying vague requirements"
- Multiple stakeholders with different interpretations of requirements
- Tool fragmentation requiring context switching for complete understanding
- Time pressure to provide breakdown before official planning sessions

**Habit Forces:**
- Creating large stories that require breakdown during development
- Relying on informal communication rather than documented requirements
- Making assumptions about business logic rather than seeking clarification
- Using personal methods for analysis outside official tools

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of missing critical requirements or edge cases in breakdown
- Concern about commitment to scope that may expand during development
- Worry about creating tasks that are too complex for junior developers
- Pressure to demonstrate competence in requirement analysis skills

### Planning Session Execution (Day 1)
**Situation:** Presenting task breakdown during sprint planning  
**Pull Forces:**
- Team appreciation for well-prepared, clearly defined tasks
- Successful estimation sessions based on comprehensive breakdown
- Productive planning discussions focused on implementation strategy

**Remaining Struggles:**
- Last-minute scope clarifications affecting previously prepared breakdown
- Difficulty estimating tasks that still contain hidden complexity
- Cross-team coordination requirements not identified during initial analysis
- Stories that remain "too large to complete in a sprint"

## Desired Progress Definition

### Functional Success Metrics
- **Story Size Optimization:** 95% of stories sized appropriately for single sprint completion
- **INVEST Compliance:** 85% of stories meet Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable criteria
- **Acceptance Criteria Clarity:** All stories include comprehensive, testable acceptance criteria
- **Vertical Slice Achievement:** Stories deliver end-to-end business value independently

### Emotional Success Metrics
- **Professional Confidence:** Feel skilled and competent in requirement analysis and breakdown
- **Scope Clarity:** Experience certainty about what needs to be built and why
- **Team Enablement:** Satisfaction from creating work that enables team productivity
