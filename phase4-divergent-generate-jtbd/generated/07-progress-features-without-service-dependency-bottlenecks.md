## Current Struggle Timeline

### Service Dependency Planning (Hour 0-2)
**Situation:** Identifying and planning for complex service dependencies required for testing  
**Push Forces:**
- Complex microservice interactions requiring coordination across 8+ services for comprehensive testing
- Resource limitations preventing full local deployment of distributed service architecture
- Service availability dependencies requiring coordination with multiple engineering teams
- Manual service configuration and data setup creating significant preparation overhead

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional commitment to thorough testing that validates realistic service interactions
- Team expectation for comprehensive feature validation across distributed system boundaries
- Personal desire for testing independence that doesn't create coordination burden for other teams

### Infrastructure Coordination (Hour 1-4)
**Situation:** Setting up service dependencies and coordinating testing infrastructure  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual service orchestration overwhelming local development resources and causing performance degradation
- Shared environment contention creating scheduling conflicts and unreliable testing conditions
- Service dependency complexity requiring expertise in multiple technology stacks and configurations
- Resource constraints preventing realistic production-like testing scenarios with full service deployment

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to use simplified service mocks that miss critical integration scenarios
- Preference for shared testing environments despite coordination overhead and reliability issues
- Inclination to test individual services in isolation rather than comprehensive integration validation
- Manual service configuration rather than automated dependency management

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that simplified testing approaches will miss critical service interaction issues
- Concern about resource impact from running complex service stacks locally
- Worry about coordination overhead affecting other teams' development productivity
- Stress about testing timeline delays due to service dependency availability

### Testing Execution and Validation (Hour 2-8)
**Situation:** Executing tests across service dependencies and validating distributed functionality  
**Push Forces:**
- Service interaction complexity making it difficult to isolate feature-specific testing scenarios
- Limited observability across service boundaries affecting test result analysis and debugging
- Brittle service mocks that break when service contracts change or evolve
- Manual correlation of test results across multiple services and distributed system components

**Pull Forces:**
- Satisfaction when testing successfully validates complex service interactions without coordination overhead
- Confidence from comprehensive validation across realistic service dependencies and integration points
- Professional recognition for independent testing approaches that maintain thoroughness without resource burden

**Success Indicators:**
- Successful feature validation across all service dependencies without external coordination
- Comprehensive testing coverage including service contract validation and integration scenarios
- Independent testing execution that doesn't impact other teams' development or infrastructure resources
- Clear progression to integration testing with confidence in distributed system functionality

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Testing bottlenecks due to service dependency availability or coordination delays
- Incomplete testing coverage due to simplified service mocking or resource limitations
- False confidence from unrealistic testing scenarios that don't reflect production service interactions
