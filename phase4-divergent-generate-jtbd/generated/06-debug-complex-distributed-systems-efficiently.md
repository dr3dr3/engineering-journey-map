## Current Struggle Timeline

### Issue Discovery (Hour 0)
**Situation:** Encountering bug or unexpected behavior in distributed system  
**Push Forces:**
- Pressure to resolve issues quickly to maintain development sprint commitments
- Previous experiences with 2-4 hour debugging sessions for complex distributed issues
- Urgency to understand whether issue is in local changes or existing system behavior
- Requirement to validate fixes across multiple service dependencies

**Pull Forces:**
- Curiosity about understanding complex system interactions and root causes
- Motivation to improve system reliability and prevent similar issues
- Desire to build expertise in debugging distributed systems effectively

### Initial Investigation (Hour 0-1)
**Situation:** Beginning debugging process and gathering information  
**Push Forces:**
- Complexity of tracing issues across 8+ microservices running locally
- Difficulty reproducing production issues due to environment differences
- Lack of integrated debugging tools that understand distributed system context
- Manual correlation of logs and metrics across multiple services and data sources

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to debug individual services in isolation rather than understanding system-wide behavior
- Preference for adding manual logging rather than using integrated debugging tools
- Inclination to focus on recent code changes rather than investigating broader system interactions

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear of making changes that might affect other services or system stability
- Concern about time investment without guaranteed resolution
- Worry about missing critical dependencies or interactions during debugging

### Deep Investigation (Hour 1-4)
**Situation:** Detailed analysis and root cause identification  
**Push Forces:**
- Complex service interactions making it difficult to isolate specific failure points
- Resource limitations preventing full local reproduction of production-like scenarios
- Manual debugging processes that are time-intensive and error-prone
- Limited visibility into production-like data flows and system behaviors

**Pull Forces:**
- Breakthrough moments when debugging tools reveal critical system interactions
- Satisfaction from understanding complex distributed system behaviors
- Incremental progress toward identifying root causes and potential solutions

### Resolution and Validation (Hour 2-6)
**Situation:** Implementing fixes and validating resolution across system  
**Push Forces:**
- Uncertainty about whether fixes address root cause or just symptoms
- Difficulty validating fixes across all affected services and interaction patterns
- Risk of introducing new issues while fixing existing problems

**Success Indicators:**
- Clear identification of root cause with comprehensive understanding of system impact
- Validated fix that resolves issue across all affected service interactions
- Improved system understanding that prevents similar issues in the future

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Temporary workarounds that don't address underlying system issues
- Partial understanding leading to recurring issues or incomplete fixes
- Excessive time investment affecting overall development productivity

## Desired Progress Definition

### Alternative Solutions Engineers Consider
- **Production Debugging:** Accessing production systems for debugging when local reproduction fails
- **Staging Environment Analysis:** Using shared environments for complex debugging scenarios
- **Expert Consultation:** Seeking help from senior developers or architects for complex distributed issues
- **Documentation Research:** Extensive documentation review to understand system interactions
