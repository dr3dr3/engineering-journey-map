- Conservative manual rollout approaches that extend timeline and reduce learning velocity when automated safeguards are unavailable

**Habit Forces:**
- Very gradual, manually managed feature rollouts with extensive coordination meetings and approval checkpoints
- Batch release strategies grouping multiple features to reduce rollout overhead but increasing deployment risk
- Customer-specific deployment processes for customized instances requiring manual validation and coordination

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that automated rollout progression will expose customers to untested features or performance issues
- Concern about mobile app store coordination delays affecting rollout timing and cross-platform consistency
- Worry about unexpected customer segment behavior that could require immediate rollout adjustment or feature disable

### Rollout Completion and Analysis (Time 3-7 days)
**Situation:** Completing customer rollout with validation of adoption targets and satisfaction metrics  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual analysis of rollout success requiring extensive data collection and stakeholder communication
- Limited automated decision support for rollout optimization and future release strategy improvement
- Complex reporting requirements for product management and business stakeholders consuming significant engineering time

**Pull Forces:**
- Automated rollout reports with adoption rates, customer satisfaction, and business impact analysis
- AI-powered insights for future rollout optimization based on feature performance and customer feedback patterns
- Comprehensive stakeholder dashboards enabling self-service visibility into rollout progress and success metrics
