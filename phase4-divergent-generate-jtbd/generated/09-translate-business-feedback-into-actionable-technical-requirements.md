## Current Struggle Timeline

### Feedback Collection and Initial Analysis (Hour 0-4)
**Situation:** Gathering stakeholder feedback and understanding business requirements behind observations  
**Push Forces:**
- Unstructured feedback collection through multiple channels including Slack, email, meetings, and ad-hoc conversations
- Only 40% of stakeholder feedback is immediately actionable requiring clarification sessions and additional coordination
- Complex business domain interpretation requiring deep understanding of stakeholder workflows and business processes
- Lost context and incomplete feedback documentation when formal feedback systems lack integration with development workflows

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional desire for structured feedback collection that provides clear business context and implementation guidance
- Business stakeholder expectation for responsive feedback processing and clear resolution communication
- Personal commitment to comprehensive understanding of business needs and accurate requirement implementation

### Technical Analysis and Requirement Translation (Hour 2-8)
**Situation:** Converting business observations into specific technical implementation requirements  
**Push Forces:**
- Manual correlation between business feedback and technical implementation components requiring extensive code analysis
- Unclear technical scope and effort estimation for addressing business feedback without automated impact analysis
- Complex dependency analysis when business changes affect multiple technical components and system interactions
- Limited automated assistance for translating business language into technical specifications and acceptance criteria

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to implement quick fixes rather than comprehensive solutions when business feedback is urgent
- Preference for technical interpretation over stakeholder clarification when business requirements are ambiguous
- Inclination to batch feedback processing rather than provide immediate response when correlation tools are unavailable
- Manual documentation of feedback-to-implementation mapping when automated traceability is insufficient

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that misinterpreted business feedback will result in additional rework and stakeholder dissatisfaction
- Concern about technical implementation that doesn't address underlying business concerns and requirements
- Worry about incomplete technical analysis that misses dependencies and creates system integration issues
- Stress about manual correlation overhead that prevents timely feedback response and resolution

### Implementation Planning and Stakeholder Communication (Hour 4-16)
**Situation:** Planning technical implementation and communicating approach back to business stakeholders  
**Push Forces:**
- Cross-team coordination for complex feedback resolution requiring multiple technical specialists and business stakeholders
- Manual effort estimation and prioritization without automated analysis of business impact and technical complexity
- Technical communication challenges when explaining implementation approach to business stakeholders with limited technical context
- Unclear ownership and accountability for feedback resolution when changes span multiple teams and system components

**Pull Forces:**
- Satisfaction from successful feedback implementation that demonstrates responsiveness to business needs
- Confidence when systematic approach provides clear implementation plan and stakeholder communication
- Professional recognition for effective business-technical translation that maintains stakeholder engagement

**Success Indicators:**
- Automated correlation of 75% of business feedback with specific technical implementation requirements
- 4-6 hour cycle time from feedback collection to actionable technical requirements with effort estimation
- 90% stakeholder satisfaction with feedback response clarity and implementation timeline communication
- Clear traceability between business feedback, technical changes, and business impact verification

**Failure Scenarios:**
- Misinterpreted business feedback resulting in technical implementation that doesn't address stakeholder concerns
- Manual correlation overhead that prevents timely feedback response and delays stakeholder engagement
- Poor business-technical communication that damages stakeholder confidence and collaborative relationship
