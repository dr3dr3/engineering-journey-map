- Difficulty measuring psychological safety and culture change progress with quantifiable metrics and clear indicators
- Competing priorities between culture development work and immediate delivery commitments that require careful balance
- Skepticism from stakeholders about value of "soft" culture work versus tangible feature development and business outcomes

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to revert to blame-oriented problem-solving when issues arise rather than focusing on systematic learning and improvement
- Individual rather than collaborative approaches to problem-solving that limit knowledge sharing and team learning opportunities
- Focus on immediate problem resolution rather than investing time in understanding root causes and preventing future issues

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that psychological safety will reduce accountability and performance standards if not properly balanced with delivery expectations
- Concern about ability to facilitate difficult conversations and manage team dynamics during cultural transition period
- Worry about maintaining team productivity during culture change efforts that require time and energy investment

### Learning Integration and Practice (Week 12-24)
**Situation:** Building sustainable learning practices and embedding experimentation into team workflows  
**Push Forces:**

- Communication challenges in maintaining stakeholder support for culture development work that may not show immediate tangible results

**Pull Forces:**
- Visible improvements in team innovation and problem-solving capabilities through systematic experimentation and learning practices
- Increased team engagement and satisfaction from psychological safety and growth-oriented culture development
- Recognition from leadership and other teams for successful culture development and high-performing team characteristics

### Cultural Sustainability and Scaling (Month 6+)
**Situation:** Maintaining experimentation culture through team changes and scaling practices to broader organization  
**Push Forces:**
- Ongoing effort required to maintain culture standards during high-pressure periods and team membership changes
- Challenge of scaling culture practices to other teams while adapting to different contexts and team dynamics

**Pull Forces:**
- Self-reinforcing culture where team members actively contribute to maintaining psychological safety and learning practices
- Organizational recognition and support for culture development that encourages continued investment and scaling efforts
- Measurable business impact from high-performing team culture that demonstrates value of experimentation and learning investment
