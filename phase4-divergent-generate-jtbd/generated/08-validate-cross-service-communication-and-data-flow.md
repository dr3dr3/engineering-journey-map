- Complex service interaction patterns requiring deep understanding of API contracts, data flows, and dependency relationships
- Limited visibility into actual communication patterns and data flow requirements across distributed services
- Manual analysis of service interfaces and communication protocols without automated discovery and mapping
- Difficulty identifying all integration scenarios that need validation due to system complexity and hidden dependencies

**Pull Forces:**
- Professional desire for comprehensive understanding of distributed system communication patterns
- Team expectation for thorough validation of cross-service interactions and data flow reliability
- Personal commitment to systematic testing that identifies potential communication failures before production

### Test Execution and Monitoring (Hour 1-6)
**Situation:** Running cross-service communication tests while monitoring distributed system behavior  
**Push Forces:**
- Limited automated testing of cross-service communication with only 30% coverage of critical integration scenarios
- Complex debugging when communication issues span multiple services requiring manual trace analysis and coordination
- Test data inconsistency across services creating unrealistic scenarios that don't reflect production communication patterns
- Manual monitoring of distributed system behavior without comprehensive observability and automated anomaly detection

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to focus on individual service testing rather than comprehensive cross-service communication validation
- Preference for simplified communication scenarios that avoid complexity but miss realistic integration challenges
- Inclination to mock service dependencies rather than test actual communication patterns and protocols
- Manual verification of communication results rather than trusting automated validation and monitoring

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that simplified testing will miss critical communication failures that emerge under production conditions
- Concern about test environment reliability and whether it accurately reflects production communication patterns
- Worry about incomplete coverage of communication scenarios due to complexity and coordination requirements
- Stress about time investment in comprehensive communication testing without guaranteed improvement in reliability

### Issue Analysis and Resolution (Hour 2-8)
**Situation:** Analyzing communication test results and coordinating resolution of distributed system issues  
**Push Forces:**
- Root cause analysis of communication failures requiring deep understanding of distributed system behavior
- Limited automated correlation of issues across multiple services and communication layers
- Manual analysis of distributed traces and logs to understand communication patterns and failure modes
- Cross-team coordination required for resolving communication issues that span service boundaries

**Pull Forces:**
- Satisfaction from comprehensive communication validation that demonstrates distributed system reliability
