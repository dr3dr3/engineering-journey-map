### Knowledge Sharing and Adaptation Challenges (Week 4-12)
**Situation:** Attempting to share improvements across teams while accommodating different contexts and requirements  
**Push Forces:**
- Resistance from teams who prefer their current processes or have "not invented here" attitudes toward external improvement suggestions
- Context differences between teams that make direct improvement adoption difficult without significant adaptation and customization
- Limited time and resources for improvement evangelism and support activities alongside ongoing delivery commitments
- Difficulty measuring improvement adoption effectiveness and impact across multiple teams with different baseline metrics and success criteria

**Habit Forces:**
- Tendency to focus on local team optimization rather than investing time in cross-team improvement sharing and organizational capability building
- Preference for informal knowledge sharing rather than systematic documentation and scaling approaches that require additional effort
- Individual team focus rather than organizational perspective that would prioritize cross-team improvement coordination and scaling

**Anxiety Forces:**
- Fear that improvement sharing efforts will be unsuccessful and waste time that could be spent on local team optimization
- Concern about ability to effectively communicate improvement practices and support other teams through implementation challenges
- Worry about responsibility for supporting other teams' improvement efforts without clear organizational mandate or resource allocation

### Organizational Adoption and Support (Week 12-24)
**Situation:** Working to achieve organizational adoption of improvements while managing coordination and support requirements  
**Push Forces:**
- Coordination complexity in supporting multiple teams through improvement implementation with different timelines and requirements
- Resource constraints in providing adequate support for improvement adoption while maintaining local team delivery commitments
- Measurement challenges in tracking improvement impact across teams and demonstrating organizational ROI for scaling efforts

**Pull Forces:**
- Visible success from early adopting teams that creates demand for improvement scaling and organizational support
- Platform engineering support that provides infrastructure and tooling to facilitate improvement adoption across teams
- Management recognition and support for improvement scaling efforts that provide resources and organizational mandate

### Sustainable Scaling and Impact (Month 6+)
**Situation:** Establishing sustainable improvement scaling processes and measuring long-term organizational impact  
**Push Forces:**
- Ongoing effort required to maintain improvement knowledge sharing and support adoption by new teams as organization grows
- Need for continuous adaptation of improvement practices as organizational context and technology landscape evolves

**Pull Forces:**
- Self-sustaining improvement culture where teams actively seek and share successful practices with minimal coordination overhead
- Organizational systems and processes that systematically capture and scale successful improvements as standard operating procedure
- Measurable business impact from improvement scaling that justifies continued investment and organizational support
