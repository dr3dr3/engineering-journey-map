# Future State Documentation Template

This template provides a structured approach to documenting your organization's desired future state to guide your Engineering Journey Map implementation and transformation roadmap.

## Purpose

Defining your desired future state is critical for successful engineering transformation because:
- Vision drives alignment across teams and stakeholders
- Clear targets enable focused improvement efforts
- Future state definition helps prioritize platform engineering investments
- Measurable goals provide success criteria and progress tracking
- Stakeholder buy-in requires a compelling vision of the future

## Template Categories

The following templates will guide you in systematically defining your desired future state:

### 1. Vision & Strategic Direction
- **File**: `01-vision-strategy.md`
- **Purpose**: Define the overall vision and strategic goals for engineering excellence

### 2. Target Developer Experience
- **File**: `02-target-developer-experience.md`
- **Purpose**: Describe the ideal day-in-the-life for developers in the future state

### 3. Desired Technical Architecture
- **File**: `03-desired-architecture.md`
- **Purpose**: Define target technical architecture and platform capabilities

### 4. Future Workflows & Processes
- **File**: `04-future-workflows.md`
- **Purpose**: Map streamlined, efficient development processes

### 5. Target Team Structure & Capabilities
- **File**: `05-target-team-structure.md`
- **Purpose**: Define optimal team organization and required capabilities

### 6. Future Tools & Platform Strategy
- **File**: `06-future-tools-platform.md`
- **Purpose**: Design the target toolchain and platform ecosystem

### 7. Desired Culture & Behaviors
- **File**: `07-desired-culture.md`
- **Purpose**: Define target cultural characteristics and behaviors

### 8. Success Metrics & Outcomes
- **File**: `08-success-metrics.md`
- **Purpose**: Establish measurable success criteria and target KPIs

### 9. Stakeholder Value Propositions
- **File**: `09-stakeholder-value.md`
- **Purpose**: Define value propositions for different stakeholder groups

### 10. Implementation Roadmap Framework
- **File**: `10-roadmap-framework.md`
- **Purpose**: Structure the transformation journey and milestones

## Relationship to Current State

These future state templates build upon the current state analysis:
- **Gap Analysis**: Compare current vs future to identify transformation needs
- **Priority Setting**: Focus on areas with the biggest current/future gaps
- **Roadmap Planning**: Sequence improvements based on dependencies and impact
- **Success Measurement**: Track progress from current baseline to future targets

## Vision-First Approach

Start with the big picture and work down to specifics:
1. **Strategic Vision** - What does success look like at the highest level?
2. **Developer Experience** - How will daily work feel different?
3. **Technical Architecture** - What capabilities will enable this experience?
4. **Implementation Planning** - How do we get there?

## Stakeholder Alignment

Use these templates to:
- **Build Consensus** around the future vision
- **Communicate Value** to different stakeholder groups  
- **Set Expectations** for transformation timeline and outcomes
- **Secure Buy-in** through clear value propositions

## Next Steps

After completing these templates:
1. **Validate Vision** with key stakeholders and teams
2. **Prioritize Initiatives** based on current/future state gaps
3. **Create Roadmap** using the implementation framework
4. **Establish Governance** for transformation oversight
5. **Begin Implementation** with quick wins and foundational changes
