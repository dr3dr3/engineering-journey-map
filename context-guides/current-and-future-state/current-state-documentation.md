# Current State Documentation Template

This template provides a structured approach to documenting your organization's current state to create an effective, tailored Engineering Journey Map.

## Purpose

Understanding your current state is critical for creating a meaningful Engineering Journey Map because:
- You can't improve what you don't understand
- Each organization has unique challenges, constraints, and contexts
- Generic solutions often fail because they don't address specific organizational realities
- Current state analysis reveals hidden pain points and workarounds that become improvement opportunities

## Template Categories

The following templates will guide you in systematically collecting current state information:

### 1. Technical Environment & Architecture
- **File**: `01-technical-environment.md`
- **Purpose**: Document the technical landscape developers work within

### 2. Development Workflows & Processes
- **File**: `02-development-workflows.md` 
- **Purpose**: Map current development processes from code to production

### 3. Team Structure & Roles
- **File**: `03-team-structure.md`
- **Purpose**: Understand organizational structure and responsibilities

### 4. Tools & Systems Inventory
- **File**: `04-tools-systems.md`
- **Purpose**: Catalog current toolchain and identify gaps/overlaps

### 5. Pain Points & Challenges
- **File**: `05-pain-points.md`
- **Purpose**: Document current friction and blockers in detail

### 6. Cultural & Behavioral Patterns
- **File**: `06-culture-behavior.md`
- **Purpose**: Understand informal practices and cultural factors

### 7. Skills & Capabilities Assessment
- **File**: `07-skills-capabilities.md`
- **Purpose**: Map current team capabilities and knowledge gaps

### 8. Business Context & Constraints
- **File**: `08-business-context.md`
- **Purpose**: Document business requirements and organizational constraints

### 9. Success Metrics & KPIs
- **File**: `09-metrics-kpis.md`
- **Purpose**: Establish baseline measurements for improvement tracking

### 10. Stakeholder Perspectives
- **File**: `10-stakeholder-perspectives.md`
- **Purpose**: Gather viewpoints from different organizational levels and roles

## How to Use These Templates

1. **Start with the business context** to understand constraints and priorities
2. **Map the technical environment** to understand the landscape
3. **Document workflows** to see how work actually gets done
4. **Identify pain points** through observation and interviews
5. **Gather multiple perspectives** to get a complete picture
6. **Validate findings** with stakeholders before proceeding

## Next Steps

After completing these templates:
1. Synthesize findings into key themes and patterns
2. Prioritize pain points by impact and frequency
3. Map current state to your Engineering Journey Map phases
4. Identify the biggest gaps between current and desired state
5. Use insights to inform platform engineering priorities
