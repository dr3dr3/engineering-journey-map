## Usage Guidelines for Platform Engineering Teams

### How to Use These Personas

1. **Journey Mapping Workshops**: Reference specific personas when mapping user journeys to ensure all user types are considered
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Use persona needs to prioritize platform features and improvements
3. **User Story Creation**: Write user stories from the perspective of specific personas
4. **Design Reviews**: Evaluate platform designs against persona goals and pain points
5. **Success Metrics**: Define success metrics that align with persona objectives

### Key Considerations

- **Experience Level Matters**: Junior developers need more guidance and guardrails, while senior engineers value flexibility and control
- **Specialization Impact**: Different engineering disciplines have unique tooling and workflow requirements
- **Cross-Functional Needs**: Consider how personas interact with each other in collaborative workflows
- **Evolution Over Time**: Personas may evolve as engineers grow in experience and the organization matures
