## Platform Team Dynamics

### How These Roles Interact

**Platform Engineers + Application Engineers**
- Platform engineers build abstractions and tools that application engineers consume
- Feedback loops are critical for platform adoption and improvement
- Tension between flexibility and simplicity in platform design

**Platform Product Manager + All Engineers**
- Bridges business requirements with technical implementation
- Translates engineering productivity improvements into business metrics
- Balances feature requests from multiple engineering teams

**Senior + Junior Platform Engineers**
- Knowledge transfer and mentoring relationships
- Code review and architectural guidance
- Shared on-call responsibilities and incident response

### Considerations for Journey Mapping

**Multi-Perspective Views**
- Platform engineers experience both building and using platform services
- Platform product managers need visibility into both user experience and business impact
- Junior platform engineers have dual perspective of learning and contributing

**Feedback Loops**
- Platform teams need mechanisms to gather and act on user feedback
- Success metrics should align with both developer experience and business outcomes
- Platform evolution should be driven by actual user needs, not just technical preferences

## Usage Guidelines for Platform Engineering Teams

### How to Use These Personas

1. **Journey Mapping Workshops**: Reference specific personas when mapping user journeys to ensure all user types are considered
2. **Feature Prioritization**: Use persona needs to prioritize platform features and improvements
3. **User Story Creation**: Write user stories from the perspective of specific personas
4. **Design Reviews**: Evaluate platform designs against persona goals and pain points
5. **Success Metrics**: Define success metrics that align with persona objectives

### Key Considerations

- **Experience Level Matters**: Junior developers need more guidance and guardrails, while senior engineers value flexibility and control
- **Specialization Impact**: Different engineering disciplines have unique tooling and workflow requirements
- **Cross-Functional Needs**: Consider how personas interact with each other in collaborative workflows
- **Evolution Over Time**: Personas may evolve as engineers grow in experience and the organization matures
