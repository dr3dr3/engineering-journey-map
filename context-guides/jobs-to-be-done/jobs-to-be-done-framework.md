# Jobs-to-be-Done Framework

The Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD) framework, as developed by Bob Moesta (working closely with Clayton Christensen), is a theory for understanding customer motivation and driving innovation. Here's a comprehensive summary:

## Core Concept

The fundamental premise is that customers don't buy products or services - they "hire" them to do a specific job. A "job" is the progress a customer is trying to make in a particular circumstance, encompassing functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

## Key Principles

**Jobs are about progress, not products.** Customers have underlying needs and desired outcomes they're trying to achieve. They evaluate and choose solutions based on how well they help make this progress.

**Context matters tremendously.** The same customer might hire different solutions for the same functional job depending on their circumstances, constraints, and situation.

**Jobs have multiple dimensions:**
- Functional (the practical task)
- Emotional (how they want to feel)
- Social (how they want to be perceived)

## The Four Forces of Progress

Moesta identifies four competing forces that influence purchase decisions:

1. **Push of the situation** - Problems or frustrations with the current state
2. **Pull of the new solution** - Attraction to a new approach
3. **Habit of the present** - Inertia and comfort with current behavior
4. **Anxiety of the new** - Concerns about switching to something unfamiliar

Progress happens when the push and pull forces overcome habit and anxiety.

## Timeline and Moments

The framework emphasizes understanding the customer's timeline - the sequence of events, emotions, and circumstances that lead to a purchase decision. Key moments include:
- First thought (initial awareness of the job)
- Passive looking (casual exploration)
- Active looking (serious evaluation)
- Moment of struggle (decision trigger)
- Purchase decision

## Practical Application

For businesses, JTBD helps with:
- Product development focused on customer progress rather than features
- Market segmentation based on jobs rather than demographics
- Competitive analysis that considers all ways customers currently solve the job
- Innovation opportunities by identifying underserved jobs or better ways to serve existing ones

The framework shifts focus from "what are customers like?" to "what job are they trying to get done?" - leading to more customer-centric innovation and positioning strategies.

## Combining with the Engineering Journey Map

Combining Jobs-to-be-Done with Customer Journey Maps creates a powerful hybrid approach that captures both the underlying motivations (why customers act) and the experiential reality (how they actually move through their journey). Here's how to integrate them effectively:

### Enhanced Journey Structure

Instead of traditional journey phases, organize your map around **job progression stages**:

- **Job emergence** - When customers first recognize they need to make progress
- **Job definition** - Clarifying what success looks like
- **Solution exploration** - Discovering and evaluating options
- **Hiring decision** - Choosing and acquiring a solution
- **Job execution** - Using the solution to make progress
- **Job completion/evolution** - Achieving the outcome or recognizing new jobs

### Multi-Dimensional Touchpoint Analysis

At each journey stage, map touchpoints across the three job dimensions:

**Functional layer** - What practical steps are they taking? What tools or channels are they using?

**Emotional layer** - How are they feeling? What emotional needs must be addressed?

**Social layer** - Who influences them? What social pressures or aspirations are at play?

### The Four Forces Integration

Overlay Moesta's four forces throughout the journey:

- **Push forces** - Map specific frustrations, pain points, and triggers at each stage
- **Pull forces** - Identify what attracts them to potential solutions
- **Habit forces** - Document existing behaviors and inertia points
- **Anxiety forces** - Highlight fears, concerns, and switching costs

This reveals why customers get stuck at certain stages or abandon their journey.

### Timeline-Rich Journey Mapping

Traditional journey maps often oversimplify timing. JTBD emphasizes that jobs unfold over extended periods with varying intensity. Your enhanced map should show:

- **Duration** of each stage (days, weeks, months)
- **Trigger events** that accelerate or pause progress
- **Moments of struggle** that create urgency
- **Passive vs active** periods of job-related activity

### Competitive Context Integration

Unlike typical journey maps that focus on your brand's touchpoints, JTBD-enhanced maps should include:

- **Alternative solutions** customers consider at each stage
- **Non-consumption** scenarios (choosing not to solve the job)
- **Workarounds** and current coping mechanisms
- **Switching patterns** between different solution categories

### Practical Implementation Steps

**Start with job definition.** Before mapping the journey, clearly articulate the core job and its functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

**Interview for job stories.** Use the format: "When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome]" to uncover specific job contexts.

**Map the struggle timeline.** Focus heavily on understanding the sequence of events that led to the purchase decision, not just the purchase process itself.

**Include non-customers.** Map journeys of people who have the job but haven't hired any solution yet, or who hired competitors.

**Validate with switching stories.** Interview customers who switched from competitors to understand what wasn't working in their previous journey.

## Key Benefits of This Integration

This hybrid approach provides richer insights than either framework alone. You understand not just what customers do, but why they're motivated to do it. You can identify innovation opportunities where current solutions inadequately serve the job. Most importantly, you can design experiences that address the deeper progress customers are trying to make, rather than just optimizing surface-level interactions.

The result is journey maps that reveal both the emotional and functional reality of customer progress, leading to more meaningful experience design and product development decisions.
