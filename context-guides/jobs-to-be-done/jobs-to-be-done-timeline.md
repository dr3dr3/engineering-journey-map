# Jobs-to-be-Done Timeline

The JTBD timeline maps the customer's journey from initial awareness of a struggle to post-purchase outcomes. Here's a detailed breakdown of each phase with Software Engineer customers:

## First Thought
**About making space for awareness**
This is when software engineers first recognize they have a problem or unfulfilled need, though they may not yet articulate it clearly. The key is creating mental and emotional space for this recognition.

*Example:* A senior software engineer realizes they're spending more time debugging deployment issues and managing infrastructure than actually building features. They start noticing the pattern during yet another late-night incident response.

*Business implication:* Content and messaging should help engineers recognize inefficiencies in their current workflow and realize that infrastructure toil is stealing time from their core value-add work.

## Passive Looking
**About casual exploration without commitment**
Engineers begin loosely exploring solutions, often through ambient discovery rather than active searching. They're gathering information but not yet committed to solving the problem.

*Example:* The engineer starts following platform engineering content on Twitter, bookmarks articles about developer productivity, and pays attention when colleagues mention internal developer platforms or CI/CD improvements during team meetings.

*Business implication:* Be present in engineering communities - technical blogs, conferences, GitHub discussions, engineering Slack channels, and developer-focused social media.

## Active Looking
**About serious evaluation and comparison**
A trigger event or accumulated frustration pushes engineers into deliberate solution-seeking. They're now actively researching, comparing options, and evaluating trade-offs.

*Example:* After a major production outage caused by configuration drift, the engineer starts actively researching platform engineering solutions, reading technical documentation, evaluating different infrastructure-as-code tools, and analyzing how other companies solved similar problems.

*Business implication:* Provide detailed technical documentation, architecture diagrams, comparison matrices, and hands-on demos. Address specific technical criteria like scalability, security, and integration capabilities.

## Deciding
**About overcoming anxiety and committing**
This is the crucial moment when engineers must overcome their anxiety about change and habit inertia to make a purchase decision. The four forces are most intense here.

*Example:* The engineer wrestles with concerns about migration complexity, learning curve for the team, potential downtime during transition, and whether leadership will support the investment in developer productivity tooling.

*Business implication:* Offer proof-of-concepts, migration assistance, comprehensive training programs, and clear ROI metrics. Provide case studies from similar engineering organizations.

## First Use
**About validating the hiring decision**
The engineer's first experience with the platform determines whether they feel they made the right choice. This phase is critical for confirming the job will actually get done.

*Example:* The engineer sets up their first service using the new platform. Can they deploy faster? Is the developer experience actually better? Are there fewer configuration errors? Does it integrate well with existing tools?

*Business implication:* Ensure smooth onboarding with clear getting-started guides, responsive technical support, and quick wins that demonstrate immediate value. Set realistic expectations about the learning curve.

## Ongoing Use
**About integrating the solution into life**
Engineers develop habits and routines around the platform. They discover additional benefits or limitations and may modify how they use it.

*Example:* The engineer and their team develop new workflows around the platform, discover advanced features like automated testing pipelines or observability integrations, and start standardizing deployment patterns across multiple services.

*Business implication:* Provide ongoing training, best practices documentation, and community forums. Support habit formation through workflow automation and integration with familiar tools.

## Evolving Needs
**About changing job definitions over time**
Engineering circumstances, priorities, or expectations change, potentially creating new jobs or modifying existing ones. They may need different solutions or enhanced capabilities.

*Example:* The engineer's job evolves from "deploy my service reliably" to "enable the entire engineering organization to ship faster" or "implement compliance and security standards across all deployments."

*Business implication:* Monitor changing organizational needs, offer expanded platform capabilities, and be prepared for engineers to need more sophisticated features as their platform adoption matures and scales.

## Key Timeline Insights for Platform Engineering

**Technical evaluation is extensive:** Engineers spend significant time in Active Looking, thoroughly evaluating technical trade-offs and architectural implications.

**Peer influence is crucial:** Engineers heavily rely on recommendations from other engineers and technical communities throughout the timeline.

**Hands-on validation required:** Engineers need to actually try the platform before committing, making trials and POCs essential.

**Team adoption complexity:** Individual engineers often need to convince their team and leadership, extending the timeline and requiring additional stakeholder considerations.

This timeline framework helps platform engineering providers understand not just what engineers do, but when and why they're ready for different types of technical engagement and support.
