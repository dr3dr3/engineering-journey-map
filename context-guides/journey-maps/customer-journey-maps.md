# Customer Journey Map Generation Guide for AI Assistants

## Purpose
Generate visual representations that document the complete customer experience across all touchpoints, capturing actions, thoughts, emotions, and opportunities for improvement.

## Required Information to Gather

Before generating a journey map, obtain:
• **Context**: Product/service type, industry, target customer segment
• **Scope**: Specific journey focus (e.g., purchase process, onboarding, support experience)
• **Customer profile**: Demographics, goals, needs, technical proficiency
• **Business objectives**: What the organization wants to learn or improve
• **Current state vs. future state**: Whether mapping existing experience or desired experience

## Essential Components to Include

### 1. Journey Stages
Define clear phases relevant to the specific context:
• Common stages: Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Onboarding → Use → Loyalty
• Adapt stages based on journey type (e.g., support journey might be: Issue Recognition → Seeking Help → Resolution → Follow-up)

### 2. For Each Stage, Document:

**Customer Elements:**
• Primary goal/objective
• Specific actions taken
• Thoughts and questions
• Emotional state (frustrated, confused, satisfied, delighted)
• Needs and expectations

**Touchpoint Details:**
• Channels used (website, app, phone, email, in-person)
• Specific interactions
• Devices or platforms
• Duration/time spent

**Pain Points & Opportunities:**
• Friction points or barriers
• Confusion or frustration triggers
• Unmet needs
• Improvement opportunities
• Potential quick wins

### 3. Supporting Layers

**Metrics (when available):**
• Drop-off rates
• Time to complete
• Customer satisfaction scores
• Support ticket volume

**Internal View:**
• Systems and processes involved
• Responsible teams/departments
• Technical limitations
• Policy constraints

## Output Format Guidelines

### Structure Options:
• **Linear timeline**: Best for sequential processes
• **Circular diagram**: For recurring/cyclical journeys
• **Swimlane format**: When showing multiple personas or channels

### Visual Elements to Use:
• **Emotion curve**: Line graph showing emotional highs/lows
• **Icons**: Represent touchpoints, channels, and actions
• **Color coding**: Distinguish stages, highlight pain points (red) vs. positive moments (green)
• **Callout boxes**: Emphasize critical insights or opportunities

## Prompting Techniques for Better Results

### Initial Discovery Questions:
1. "What specific journey should we map?" (purchase, onboarding, support, renewal, etc.)
2. "Who is the primary customer/user?"
3. "What triggers this journey?"
4. "What constitutes success for both customer and business?"
5. "What data or research exists about this journey?"

### For Each Stage, Ask:
• "What is the customer trying to accomplish?"
• "What questions do they have?"
• "What might frustrate or delight them here?"
• "What happens if this step fails?"
• "Who else is involved at this point?"

### Validation Questions:
• "Does this flow match real customer behavior?"
• "Are there alternative paths customers might take?"
• "What assumptions are we making?"
• "Where do most customers struggle?"

## Quality Checklist

Ensure the journey map:
- [ ] Focuses on one primary persona/segment
- [ ] Includes emotional journey, not just functional steps
- [ ] Identifies specific, actionable pain points
- [ ] Shows all relevant touchpoints and channels
- [ ] Highlights moments of truth (critical decision points)
- [ ] Includes enough detail to be useful but not overwhelming
- [ ] Distinguishes between current state and assumptions
- [ ] Provides clear improvement recommendations
- [ ] Is visually organized and easy to follow

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

• **Too generic**: Ensure specific to the actual product/service
• **Inside-out thinking**: Focus on customer perspective, not internal processes
• **Missing emotional layer**: Include feelings, not just actions
• **Assumption-based**: Flag where real data is needed
• **Too complex**: Keep focused on key insights and actions
• **Endpoint confusion**: Clearly define where journey begins and ends
• **Static documentation**: Note that maps should evolve with new insights

## Adaptation Notes

Adjust the framework based on:
• **B2B vs. B2C**: B2B journeys often have multiple stakeholders and longer timelines
• **Digital vs. physical products**: Different touchpoint emphasis
• **Service vs. product**: Service journeys may have more human touchpoints
• **Industry requirements**: Healthcare, financial services may need compliance considerations
