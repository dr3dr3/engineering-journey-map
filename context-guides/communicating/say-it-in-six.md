# Say it in six

How to say exactly what you mean in six minutes or less.

A book by Ron Hoff

- If you don’t have a burning issue, don’t have a meeting!
- Summarize the overall issue, getting to the core of the overall issue
- Focus on the self-interest of the audience (why it matters to them, from their perspective)
- Keep it to within 30 seconds

# 2. The Overview

> Here is a quick overview… just a bit of background…

- Say why you think this burning issue has developed
- Say where you think to find the answer
- Connect past to present, setting the stage for a discussion on future
- Keep it to within 60 seconds

# 3. The Idea Made Tangible

> This led to an idea…

- Audiences are skeptical of free-floating ideas (i.e. opinions, not substantive)
- You have got to give the audience evidence that you/team have actually done some work
- Your evidence must be tangible
- Keep it to within 120 seconds

# 4. The Payoff

> The idea will more than pay for itself. Here is the payoff…

- The simpler you can keep this section, the better
- Must prove there is a “return on investment” for the time/effort on this topic
- Focus on one key action
- Once you see heads nodding, you don’t have to push it much further
- Mention one or two additional benefits, but keep it moving
- Keep it to within 120 seconds

# 5. Interactive Close

> Here is what we need from you to get going…

- Here you tell the audience it is their decision to make
- And that you want to hear what they think about your idea / topic
- Foster interaction (discussion, stand up and stretch, touch the tangible)
- Decisions get made during the interaction, more so than during the speech or presentation
- Keep it to within 30 seconds (excluding interaction time)

# Style of the Speaker

- Starts fast
- Speak at least 150 works a minute (don’t worry if going too fast)
- Almost memorizes
- Never equivocates
- Never gives choices
- Never leaves any doubt about his or her position
- Rivets people with eye contact
- Stands, if possible. If sitting, never slouches (sit up!)
- Gestures only when making a point
- Short sentences (break it up, make it clear, no baloney)
- Be polite to everybody, but don’t cotton up to anybody
- Concentrate on what your audience wants to know
- Write like people talk
- Rely on candor
- Use “picture words” (tangible things people can see in their mind)

> Nervousness is very **selfish**. You’re afraid you’ll be boring. You’re just pain afraid… mostly for **yourself**. How about being deeply concerned about the **audience’s problem** that you have been asked to address? How about being deeply fearful for their welfare? The sooner you transfer the deep concern you feel for yourself to the deep concern you should be feeling for your audience, the sooner you’ll be **over your nervousness**.
