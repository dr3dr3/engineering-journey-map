# Platform-as-a-Product Approach

The approach of taking a "product approach" to Platform Engineering, often referred to as **"Platform-as-a-Product,"** mandates that the platform team treats their internal development teams as their customers. This involves designing, building, and maintaining the Internal Developer Platform (IDP) as a product that continuously evolves based on user needs and feedback.

## Value of Adopting the Product Approach

Adopting a Platform-as-a-Product mindset yields significant benefits, largely centered around efficiency, customer satisfaction (Developer Experience, or DevEx), and business outcomes:

1.  **Enabling Developer Autonomy and Focus:** The primary goal is to **enable developers to be self-sufficient** by providing services that enable them to perform tasks outside their core competency. This allows application developers to focus on writing code and delivering business logic.
2.  **Increased Productivity and Business Impact:** Internal Developer Platforms increase productivity, often drastically. Measurable business benefits include reducing lead time, increasing deployment frequency, and decreasing Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and change failure rate (CFR). Ultimately, this leads to reduced time to market and costs, while innovation increases.
3.  **Efficiency for Platform Teams:** By creating services for self-service consumption, the platform team is freed from "Ticket-Ops" (waiting for and fulfilling individual Jira tickets). This allows them to focus on creating services that can be widely consumed.
4.  **Enforcing Standards and Compliance:** By using the platform's services, constraints, guidance, and guardrails are provided to the consuming teams. This ensures that services meet the company’s rules and standards while meeting developer needs, which helps drive standardization and compliance by design.
5.  **Quality and Adoption:** Treating the platform as a product ensures the platform must win over and satisfy internal customers. This creates an effective internal marketplace of capabilities, ensuring the platform is the easiest and most appealing choice available, minimizing the risk of teams bypassing the platform for other internal or external alternatives.

## Reasons to Adopt or Not Adopt (Trade-offs)

### Reasons to Adopt (Adoption is generally recommended for success in Platform Engineering):
The product approach is viewed as a **core concept** of modern product management that lays the foundation for Platform Engineering.

*   **Customization and Fit:** Building an IDP is the preferable way for bigger companies, especially those with existing assets, because it can be tailor-made to their specific needs, adapting the solution to the company rather than forcing the company to adapt to an opinionated third-party tool.
*   **Scalability:** The goal is to design reproducible programs and outcomes to enable repeatability and scalability.
*   **Necessity:** Without a focus on customer needs, internal developer platforms often **miss the mark** and require endless iterations to become useful. Platforms built with poor customer focus will likely create tools that teams hate and quickly abandon.

### Reasons Not to Adopt (Risks and Challenges):
While the product approach is foundational, the implementation presents significant challenges:

*   **Difficulty in Requirement Gathering:** Most platform engineers struggle to anticipate every developer requirement. The gap between what platform engineers think developers need and what they actually need is often enormous and very difficult to bridge.
*   **Risk of Endless Iteration:** Platform engineers spend a tremendous amount of time going through a **classic startup cycle**—trying to understand developer wants, building something, often failing to deliver what is needed, and then iterating endlessly until stumbling onto something useful (similar to searching for market fit).
*   **Platform Overload:** A risk is that the platform team takes on too many responsibilities (an anti-pattern often involving unstructured feature expansion, like managing data lakes or hosting static sites), which can lead to inefficiency and burnout.

## Practices Involved in Taking the Product Approach

Taking a Platform-as-a-Product approach involves rigorous planning, execution, and continuous feedback loops:

1.  **Discovery and Planning:**
    *   The initiative starts with a **Discovery Phase** to identify the platform's "why".
    *   Platform teams must approach the problem by thinking through the **ideal user experience** first, before writing implementation details, which is a form of Test-Driven Development (TDD).
    *   Platform goals must be **aligned with broader business objectives** and focus on desired business outcomes (like competitiveness, innovation, and customer satisfaction).
    *   Teams must use pain/value mapping to understand non-technical stakeholders (e.g., Finance, Executives) and map developer pain points to measurable business losses to calculate Return on Investment (ROI).
    *   The initial delivery often focuses on a **Minimum Viable Platform (MVP)** designed to quickly demonstrate value and support future scalability.

2.  **Creating the Platform Foundation (Building Blocks):**
    *   Platform Engineers (Service Owners) focus on creating the underlying structure, including guidance, restrictions, governance, and guardrails that define how things should work in the organization.
    *   They provide the technical building blocks (e.g., Kubernetes CRDs, controllers, policies, system prompts) that define the platform's capabilities and constraints.
    *   A critical decision involves determining which components to **Build vs. Buy** based on factors like customization criticality, cost, flexibility, and internal talent.

3.  **Implementing Developer Self-Service and Interfaces:**
    *   The core of the platform must be accessible through an **API**. This is how people and tools interact with services.
    *   The platform should offer tailor-made services rather than low-level ingredients (e.g., ordering a database server instead of networking, storage, or compute).
    *   User interfaces (like web portals, CLIs, or IDE extensions) are optional components that make the platform more user-friendly and easier to consume.
    *   Ideally, the Developer Portal console should be "dumb" (containing little logic) and rely on the platform's APIs for discoverability, schemas, operations, and observability.

4.  **Continuous Feedback and Iteration:**
    *   The process utilizes an **Onboarding Loop**, which is a continuous, structured cycle designed to make team onboarding predictable and scalable. This loop involves preparation, active onboarding, and iterative refinement based on feedback.
    *   The team must proactively **gather feedback** through structured channels like ticketing systems, regular check-ins, and surveys.
    *   Platform adoption is treated like a product launch, involving continuous promotion, engagement, and celebration of success to build cultural buy-in and momentum.
    *   Metrics are continuously measured, including business KPIs and specific Platform Engineering Success Metrics (like Complexity Index, Onboarding Time, and Service Create Time) to demonstrate ongoing value and guide future development.
