The sources extensively discuss the concept that an Internal Developer Platform (IDP) must be **optional to use** when approached with the **Platform as a Product (PaaP) mindset**. This optionality is presented not merely as a preference, but as a critical element that ensures the platform's success, quality, and high adoption rates among internal users.

### Core Principles Connecting PaaP and Optionality

The fundamental alignment between PaaP and the necessity of being optional is driven by the fact that developers are treated explicitly as **customers** of the platform team.

1.  **Ensuring Voluntary Adoption (The "Compelling Product"):** The goal of the platform team is to build a product so **compelling** that users **voluntarily** choose to adopt the platform. This approach requires platform teams to understand developers' pain points, because building a compelling product is the **only way to ensure adoption**.
2.  **Creating the Path of Least Resistance:** The platform should create a **path of least resistance**. It should make **"the right thing the easiest thing to do"**. If the platform is difficult to use, or if it is a poor fit for a team's needs, but is mandatory, it increases their cognitive load and effort, which is the opposite of the platform's intended function.
3.  **Driving Incentives and Quality:** If the platform is optional, it puts important incentives on the platform team to focus intensely on users and their needs. This focus includes building just what users need, and not more than that, in line with the concept of a **Thinnest Viable Platform**.
4.  **Maintaining Flexibility (Avoiding the Golden Cage):** While the platform provides standardized workflows or "Golden Paths," it must not become a **"Golden Cage"**. Developers must retain the **freedom to deviate** or **"go off path"** when necessary.

### The Dangers of Mandatory Platforms

Forcing platform adoption is identified as a significant anti-pattern that leads to negative outcomes for both the platform team and the internal customers.

*   **Closing Feedback Loops:** If a platform is mandatory, users may perceive that their feedback does not matter, leading them to not bother providing it. An **optional approach invites more discussion and innovation** from users, fostering better design and fit-for-purpose features.
*   **Success In Spite Of:** When platforms are mandated, teams may still be successful, but it might be **"in spite of the platform rather than because of it,"** damaging the platform's reputation.
*   **Focusing on Ops Problems:** A platform engineering initiative can fail if the team builds a platform for **themselves** (solving Ops problems) rather than for the **developers** (solving developer problems). If adoption is mandatory, this misalignment may not be immediately obvious.
*   **Cultural Division:** Making the platform mandatory can contribute to an unhealthy **"US versus them"** division, where the platform team focuses on adding barriers to prevent developers from breaking the platform, and developers feel constrained.

### Dealing with Compliance and Mandates

While strict mandates should generally be avoided, the sources acknowledge that pressure for mandatory usage often arises from regulatory or security compliance requirements.

*   **Compliance as a Feature:** Instead of forcing usage, the platform should define and clearly communicate the security or compliance requirements, and then offer the platform as the simplest option for achieving it.
*   **Using "Carrots" vs. "Sticks":** The correct approach is to entice developers onto the platform using a **"carrot"** (making it faster and easier), rather than forcing them with a **"stick"** (mandate). By implementing **"Security by Design,"** the platform ensures that the default path is the compliant and secure one, removing complexity for developers.

### The Maturity Perspective

The importance of optionality is also reflected in the Platform Engineering Maturity Model:

*   A platform at the highest maturity level, **Optimizing**, achieves adoption through **Intrinsic pull** (users are drawn to it).
*   In contrast, management thinking about making a platform mandatory often occurs when platform usage is **low**, indicative of a low maturity stage (e.g., Provisional or Operational).
